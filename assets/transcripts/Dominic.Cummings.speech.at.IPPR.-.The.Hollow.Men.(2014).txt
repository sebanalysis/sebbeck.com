[00:00.000 -> 00:44.480]  I'm going to show you a quick demo. Welcome to IPPR.
[00:44.480 -> 00:46.680]  I'm Nick Pearce, I'm the director here, and
[00:46.680 -> 00:49.520]  I'm very pleased today to introduce you to Dominic Cummings.
[00:49.520 -> 00:54.840]  Dominic is probably the only special advisor I can think of in recent memory
[00:54.840 -> 00:57.560]  who sort of anybody outside Whitehall knows.
[00:57.560 -> 00:59.880]  That's because he has very interesting and
[00:59.880 -> 01:02.760]  controversial views and he's not afraid of expressing them.
[01:02.760 -> 01:06.480]  He's here today to talk to us about the reform of Whitehall and Westminster,
[01:06.480 -> 01:09.600]  what needs to change in the civil service and in our politics.
[01:09.600 -> 01:13.160]  And so we look forward to what I'm sure will be very interesting and
[01:13.160 -> 01:14.520]  provocative remarks.
[01:14.520 -> 01:16.320]  I'll then ask Dominic some questions and
[01:16.320 -> 01:18.480]  then later on there'll be some opportunity for some debate.
[01:18.480 -> 01:19.440]  So Dominic, over to you.
[01:19.440 -> 01:32.120]  Thank you. I'm happily unemployed, very happily unemployed at the moment, so I've got lots of time for
[01:32.120 -> 01:38.040]  question and answers later on if people, I can keep answering questions as long as people
[01:38.040 -> 01:41.360]  would like me to afterwards.
[01:41.360 -> 01:45.000]  So over the next six months or so, everyone's going to be focused on the election.
[01:45.000 -> 01:52.000]  But one of my basic points is, I don't think it really matters what happens in the election.
[01:52.000 -> 01:56.000]  It won't really change some very important fundamentals.
[01:56.000 -> 02:02.000]  Whoever, whether it's Cameron or Miliband who get in, we're going to have someone with very similar education,
[02:02.000 -> 02:05.900]  very similar experience, very similar intellectual outlook.
[02:06.940 -> 02:09.380]  Neither of them know how to prioritize.
[02:09.380 -> 02:11.880]  Neither of them can build a serious team.
[02:12.920 -> 02:15.980]  They're both surrounded by these dysfunctional teams
[02:15.980 -> 02:17.520]  all day, every day.
[02:18.260 -> 02:20.060]  They don't know how to get anything done.
[02:20.060 -> 02:21.920]  They've never had experience in an organization
[02:21.920 -> 02:24.200]  watching anyone who really knows how to get anything done
[02:24.200 -> 02:27.500]  in a real alpha organization that's well managed.
[02:28.100 -> 02:31.100]  They don't understand why Whitehall around them doesn't work.
[02:32.000 -> 02:44.700]  And whichever one wins, we're going to have someone who looks at things, I think, with quite a narrow short-term party advantage and obsessed with just trying to get through the next news cycle or a few days ahead.
[02:43.600 -> 02:45.440]  with just trying to get through the next news cycle or a few days ahead.
[02:45.440 -> 02:46.960]  That's certainly how Number 10 operates.
[02:46.960 -> 02:51.240]  And looking at the Miliband's operation now,
[02:51.240 -> 02:53.520]  I think it doesn't make much difference
[02:53.520 -> 02:54.480]  which of them get in.
[02:54.480 -> 02:56.000]  So I think we need to do things differently,
[02:56.000 -> 02:58.880]  but I want to put how I think we should do things differently
[02:58.880 -> 03:03.040]  in a broader context of just Westminster and Whitehall.
[03:03.040 -> 03:05.160]  So I'll talk briefly about some fundamental
[03:05.160 -> 03:11.000]  aspects of how the world works, why some aspects of human endeavours work better than others,
[03:11.000 -> 03:16.480]  compare that with Whitehall and Westminster and talk about the core of why the systems
[03:16.480 -> 03:21.160]  don't work, have a think about the scale of the problems that these failing systems have
[03:21.160 -> 03:25.540]  to cope with, and then talk about what I think we should do
[03:25.540 -> 03:29.960]  to change it.
[03:29.960 -> 03:34.400]  The first section on this, the fundamental aspects of how the world works. It's a very
[03:34.400 -> 03:39.080]  simple point, but a very important one I think, about sheer complexity. On Friday, if David
[03:39.080 -> 03:42.640]  Cameron wants to get together all the people, wants to get together 60 people and blame
[03:42.640 -> 03:49.120]  them for why the by-election went wrong, He wants to line them all up in a row and go after one after
[03:49.120 -> 03:53.560]  one and tell them it's your fault, it's your fault. There is, roughly speaking,
[03:53.560 -> 03:56.160]  the number of different ways in which you could arrange those 60 people is
[03:56.160 -> 04:00.520]  approximately 10 to the power 80. That's about the number of atoms in the
[04:00.520 -> 04:06.600]  universe. So you see quickly that even a very simple problem like that, like how to line up 60 people in a row,
[04:06.600 -> 04:09.840]  explodes to astronomical complexity.
[04:09.840 -> 04:11.920]  How does the world cope with this?
[04:11.920 -> 04:15.400]  Well, if you look around at social networks,
[04:15.400 -> 04:18.200]  physical networks, mental networks,
[04:18.200 -> 04:22.800]  they consist of complicated, nonlinear,
[04:22.800 -> 04:24.800]  and independent systems.
[04:24.800 -> 04:27.600]  In these networks, properties emerge from the interaction
[04:27.600 -> 04:29.800]  of lots of different agents.
[04:29.800 -> 04:31.040]  You can't tell what's going to happen
[04:31.040 -> 04:33.140]  just by looking at a single agent.
[04:33.140 -> 04:36.120]  So for example, if you look at ant colonies,
[04:36.120 -> 04:38.240]  you have lots of interacting ants,
[04:38.240 -> 04:40.440]  and from this you have emergent behaviors
[04:40.440 -> 04:42.760]  like farming, slavery, and war
[04:42.760 -> 04:51.000]  that you can never predict from a single ant. If you look at the immune system, the immune system operates with lots of interacting cells
[04:51.000 -> 04:55.720]  and they produce the emergent properties of the immune system, the defense system, interacting
[04:55.720 -> 05:00.800]  via molecular signals. If you look at brains, you see individual neurons interacting via
[05:00.800 -> 05:08.820]  synapses and these produce emergent properties that we think of as thoughts. And what are the common features of these? Well the
[05:08.820 -> 05:13.800]  extreme complexity means that prediction is extremely difficult over even over
[05:13.800 -> 05:19.240]  tiny time scales. Effective action is very hard, even loose control is very
[05:19.240 -> 05:24.320]  hard, failure is ubiquitous, local failure is ubiquitous. It means the scale of
[05:24.320 -> 05:26.460]  complexity means you can't have centralized control.
[05:26.460 -> 05:30.460]  There's no master ant, there's no master neuron, there's no master immune cell.
[05:31.220 -> 05:34.140]  The system has to learn from decentralized experimentation,
[05:34.300 -> 05:37.620]  from trial and error, and from probabilistic experimentation.
[05:38.100 -> 05:40.060]  So adaptation is vital.
[05:41.300 -> 05:49.000]  And the fourth thing you see in these networks is some very interesting is two interesting qualities that come out of them.
[05:49.000 -> 05:55.000]  The networks, including the three that I've discussed, are what's known as scale-free networks.
[05:55.000 -> 06:01.000]  A simple way to imagine what these are. Picture the continental United States and a flight map of all the different flights.
[06:01.000 -> 06:07.560]  And you'll see certain hubs like Atlanta, LA, New York and whatnot. And this hub and spoke
[06:07.560 -> 06:12.560]  network you see throughout the world. You see it in brains, you see it on the internet, you see it
[06:12.560 -> 06:20.080]  in market structures, you see it in terrorist networks. And these sort of networks have two
[06:20.080 -> 06:24.360]  characteristics. One is they're resilient to random failure, so you can knock out individual things
[06:24.360 -> 06:26.720]  randomly and the system will keep working, but they're
[06:26.720 -> 06:31.640]  very vulnerable to knocking out hubs. If you knock out crucial hubs then you see
[06:31.640 -> 06:36.160]  cascades, sorry, start cascading through the system, errors start cascading
[06:36.160 -> 06:44.480]  through the system. Now some parts of human life have evolved systems to cope
[06:44.480 -> 06:45.720]  with this very well.
[06:45.720 -> 06:47.320]  Science and markets have both developed
[06:47.320 -> 06:48.720]  institutional mechanisms that allow
[06:48.720 -> 06:51.520]  us to cope with this complexity.
[06:51.520 -> 06:54.020]  In markets, you see a similar sort of system.
[06:54.020 -> 06:56.280]  You see individual humans, individual firms
[06:56.280 -> 06:59.600]  interacting via price mechanism, all sorts
[06:59.600 -> 07:02.120]  of global emergent properties.
[07:02.120 -> 07:04.880]  Like the immune system, you see local decision-making,
[07:04.880 -> 07:05.360]  probabilistic
[07:05.360 -> 07:11.520]  experimentation, reinforced success, and cull failure. In science, since Newton, you've seen
[07:11.520 -> 07:17.440]  the development of the whole scientific method, with peer review, scientists having to make data
[07:17.440 -> 07:26.160]  open, however prestigious and powerful they are. So you have, markets and science you have systems that have evolved which try
[07:26.160 -> 07:32.040]  and cope with this level of complexity and make people correct errors which in lots of
[07:32.040 -> 07:37.680]  ways we're not programmed by evolution to do very well when we're faced with these sort
[07:37.680 -> 07:42.720]  of problems. Now it doesn't work perfectly, you've got a clear hierarchy so at one end
[07:42.720 -> 07:47.920]  you've got maths and physics, you've seen recently the comet, we can send things zillions of miles away with
[07:47.920 -> 07:52.480]  extreme precision, land, the systems we understand extremely well. The far end of
[07:52.480 -> 07:55.640]  that I would say probably you've got things like sociology and education
[07:55.640 -> 08:00.800]  research which are very very far away from the way in which maths and physics
[08:00.800 -> 08:05.120]  work. The reasons for that are interesting, we can explore that in questions
[08:05.120 -> 08:10.560]  and answers if people would like. So now we compare those things that work with politics
[08:10.560 -> 08:17.120]  and what do we see? We see extremely bad prediction amid complexity and there's groundworking empirical
[08:17.120 -> 08:21.600]  information on this, particularly a work by a guy called Philip Tetlock who tracked expert decision
[08:21.600 -> 08:30.480]  making over decades and what he found unsurprisingly is that these expert decisions are almost random. There are a
[08:30.480 -> 08:33.320]  few people that do, there's a tiny number of people who do better than everyone
[08:33.320 -> 08:38.360]  else but most people it's like chimps throwing darts at the board. Secondly, the
[08:38.360 -> 08:41.480]  more likely these people are to be on TV the more likely they are to be wrong.
[08:41.480 -> 08:48.040]  And third, just very important, third people
[08:48.040 -> 08:51.880]  don't really learn very much, they don't learn from their mistakes because unlike
[08:51.880 -> 08:55.120]  in markets and science where there's feedback all the time, your company goes bust,
[08:55.120 -> 08:59.240]  the peer review system says your experiments are bad, there isn't the same kind of
[08:59.240 -> 09:06.000]  feedback in the political world so people aren't punished for failures. So it's obviously important that expert opinion
[09:06.000 -> 09:10.000]  is largely rubbish.
[09:10.000 -> 09:13.400]  Secondly, most political institutions control what they do
[09:13.400 -> 09:18.000]  badly, they do a bad job of it. Why is that? First of all, goals.
[09:18.000 -> 09:21.200]  It's much easier to define goals in markets, make a profit,
[09:21.200 -> 09:24.320]  or find a particle within these physical parameters
[09:24.320 -> 09:27.840]  than it is in politics. It's much harder to formulate clear goals.
[09:27.840 -> 09:32.000]  Secondly, the nature of the people. So political bureaucracies tend to select
[09:32.000 -> 09:32.640]  for
[09:32.640 -> 09:36.640]  narcissists and for certain kinds of bureaucratic mentality.
[09:36.640 -> 09:40.480]  And look around Parliament, what are the kind of people that get ahead?
[09:40.480 -> 09:43.880]  There tend to be people who are glib, who enjoy public speaking,
[09:43.880 -> 09:49.480]  enjoy networking, lots of judgments are made on the basis of speeches and jokes. You
[09:49.480 -> 09:52.360]  watch a little group of MPs, often you see they're all just sitting there
[09:52.360 -> 09:55.760]  watching their phones waiting for a chance to interrupt. They like talking,
[09:55.760 -> 10:00.120]  they don't really like listening. These institutions tend to fill up
[10:00.120 -> 10:04.520]  with people like lawyers who are obsessed with process and PR people and
[10:04.520 -> 10:05.800]  the kind of people who are often with process and PR people and the kind of
[10:05.800 -> 10:10.140]  people who are often energised by social networking, whereas a lot of people who actually get things
[10:10.140 -> 10:14.200]  done in the world are often repelled by social networking. They're externally oriented, they're
[10:14.200 -> 10:18.440]  not interested in climbing the greasy pole. So if you look around it, how many of our
[10:18.440 -> 10:24.280]  best mathematicians, our best research scientists and the best entrepreneurs who actually build
[10:24.280 -> 10:29.280]  successful organisations in the world are represented at the top of decision making in Westminster and Whitehall.
[10:29.280 -> 10:35.520]  The answer is approximately zero. We then take that pool of people and we select ministers from them
[10:36.480 -> 10:39.440]  and then we promote them on the basis of launching gimmicks to the lobby
[10:40.640 -> 10:49.840]  and whether or not they help the party and harm the enemy party. So we then select people, so we've got a bad pool of people to begin with, and then we select from those,
[10:49.840 -> 10:53.560]  from that pool, people in a not very sensible way.
[10:53.560 -> 10:56.880]  And then we educate and train them badly. So,
[10:56.880 -> 11:00.760]  first of all, in one way, quantitative skills.
[11:00.760 -> 11:04.040]  For a simple example, to understand financial markets, you need to know what normal distribution,
[11:04.040 -> 11:10.860]  financial markets, and the financial crisis in 2007-8, you need to know what normal distribution is.
[11:10.860 -> 11:15.940]  But almost none of the people who come through into leading roles in politics are ever trained
[11:15.940 -> 11:19.700]  to know what normal distribution is. In fact, you can go all the way through maths A level
[11:19.700 -> 11:23.860]  and further maths A level now without ever learning what it is. So you have people in
[11:23.860 -> 11:28.320]  charge who have no technical understanding of very basic concepts, actually not very basic, extremely subtle,
[11:28.320 -> 11:34.600]  but in some sense basic concepts such as randomness. But it's much worse than that. If we just
[11:34.600 -> 11:39.640]  look at basic probability, the Royal Statistical Society recently did a survey, found that
[11:39.640 -> 11:46.680]  only 40% of MPs could correctly answer the question, what's the probability of getting two heads from flipping a fair coin twice?
[11:47.820 -> 11:50.240]  The three quarters of the MPs said
[11:50.240 -> 11:51.740]  that they got the right answer.
[11:54.320 -> 11:57.200]  Part of, so there's a narrow problem and a broad problem.
[11:57.200 -> 12:00.840]  The narrow problem is PPE and economics training.
[12:02.320 -> 12:03.920]  I'm constantly astonished at how people
[12:03.920 -> 12:05.160]  who've gone through economics
[12:05.160 -> 12:08.440]  degrees in PPE have very little understanding of the intellectual
[12:08.440 -> 12:11.480]  history of their field and very little understanding of how physical scientists
[12:11.480 -> 12:15.760]  regard predictions, how you actually make robust predictions in the world and
[12:15.760 -> 12:21.540]  therefore unsurprisingly these people don't understand the dodginess of the
[12:21.540 -> 12:25.880]  predictions which they're constantly making and in
[12:25.880 -> 12:32.960]  economics. They are encouraged to think that they've been trained by this
[12:32.960 -> 12:36.080]  process to make very important decisions but they don't know the
[12:36.080 -> 12:39.520]  very basics of how organizations work. They think they've been taught to run the
[12:39.520 -> 12:43.240]  country but a lot of them can't even run their own diaries. It's a broader problem
[12:43.240 -> 12:47.280]  than just PPE. In general, Westminster and Whitehall
[12:47.280 -> 12:49.240]  are dominated by arts graduates
[12:49.240 -> 12:51.960]  with very poor quantitative skills,
[12:51.960 -> 12:53.640]  little to no understanding of important
[12:53.640 -> 12:56.560]  scientific and technological issues,
[12:56.560 -> 12:59.040]  and little or no experience of successful organisations
[12:59.040 -> 13:01.440]  or responsibility for big organisations.
[13:01.440 -> 13:02.920]  And to think of the scale mismatch,
[13:02.920 -> 13:04.560]  most MPs have never been responsible
[13:04.560 -> 13:09.520]  for managing even 100 people. They're suddenly put in charge of managing sometimes 10,000
[13:09.520 -> 13:14.000]  people or more. They've never managed a budget of a million quid and suddenly they're managing
[13:14.000 -> 13:21.000]  budgets, the DFE of say 70 billion quid, about a billion quid a week. Look at poor Cameron.
[13:21.440 -> 13:24.760]  Cameron bounces from PPE to special advisor to being in charge of the Conservative Party
[13:24.760 -> 13:26.000]  to being Prime Minister.
[13:26.000 -> 13:36.000]  He's never been part of an organisation that's run well or anything approaching anything that requires making decisions on the scale that suddenly he's involved in.
[13:36.000 -> 13:41.000]  And there's no training systems in Whitehall that can begin to cope with this.
[13:41.000 -> 13:47.600]  So then you take this poor minister and you think, okay, well what are the tools that they've got?
[13:47.600 -> 13:51.760]  So think, who are the big CEOs that we think of
[13:51.760 -> 13:55.800]  for the last few years? People like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, these kind of
[13:55.800 -> 13:56.400]  characters.
[13:56.400 -> 13:59.640]  All these people can hire, fire, promote
[13:59.640 -> 14:04.640]  and train their teams, but no minister
[14:04.640 -> 14:07.760]  has the power to do any of this in their
[14:07.760 -> 14:13.320]  government department. So you have often the wrong people with bad education and
[14:13.320 -> 14:17.840]  training for the systems that they're supposed to cope with, no experience of
[14:17.840 -> 14:22.480]  the scale of the system that they're suddenly in charge of, and they have to
[14:22.480 -> 14:25.040]  do all of this without any of the very basic tools that someone
[14:25.040 -> 14:29.420]  like Bill Gates would say instantly, well how on earth are you supposed to be responsible
[14:29.420 -> 14:35.400]  and manage the system. So it's unsurprising that lots of these things go wrong. On top
[14:35.400 -> 14:38.520]  of that they're not allowed to have any help, which is why the civil service is extremely
[14:38.520 -> 14:51.920]  effective, tries very hard and is largely, I would say 99% effective of keeping special advisors and other people out of the business about appointments and those crucial, crucial decisions.
[14:51.920 -> 14:58.640]  That brings us on to civil service and HR systems. The people who are promoted tend
[14:58.640 -> 15:04.360]  to be people who protect the system and don't walk the boat. A lot of young people who care,
[15:04.360 -> 15:10.040]  work hard, are often disillusioned quite quickly and leave. And the ones who play the system and don't rock the boat. A lot of young people who care, work hard often disillusion quite quickly and leave. And the ones who play the system and focus
[15:10.040 -> 15:16.440]  on personal goals, not the public interest, often tend to be the ones who are promoted.
[15:16.440 -> 15:21.840]  It promotes people who focus on being important, not getting important things done. And it
[15:21.840 -> 15:25.500]  ruthlessly weeds out people who are dissenters, who
[15:25.500 -> 15:30.680]  are mavericks, who have a different point of view. So if you have an entire
[15:30.680 -> 15:34.080]  institutional structure that selects against the skills of entrepreneurs and
[15:34.080 -> 15:38.240]  successful scientists, don't be surprised when the people in charge can't solve
[15:38.240 -> 15:42.760]  problems like entrepreneurs and scientists. In organizations that work
[15:42.760 -> 15:48.860]  very well in the world you see people that care, they try hard. In large parts of civil service the whole HR
[15:48.860 -> 15:53.500]  system encourages the opposite. Almost nobody's ever fired but more important
[15:53.500 -> 15:58.300]  than that everything pushes against a culture of responsibility and excellence.
[15:58.300 -> 16:03.940]  Failure is not absolutely normal, it's not something to be avoided. Time after
[16:03.940 -> 16:07.720]  time after time I would be in the department and we'd be leading the news and you'd look at the TV screen here
[16:07.720 -> 16:13.320]  saying latest Gove disaster, Gove botches X. And you'd look through the glass screen
[16:13.320 -> 16:17.040]  and you'd see the official responsible for it in the lift, pottering home at 3.30 in
[16:17.040 -> 16:28.000]  the afternoon, doesn't care. Why not? Because failure is normal. it's not something to be avoided, and the HR system reinforces that.
[16:28.000 -> 16:34.000]  Why did we ban announcements on Mondays? Because you can't assemble a team reliably on a Friday.
[16:34.000 -> 16:40.000]  Between flexi hours, compressed hours, and a culture which says it's perfectly acceptable just to go on holiday
[16:40.000 -> 16:43.000]  the day before an announcement you've been working on for the last six months,
[16:43.000 -> 16:46.240]  it's very hard to get the people who are responsible for something in the same
[16:46.240 -> 16:50.000]  room. So we just had to ban announcements on a Monday because otherwise we knew
[16:50.000 -> 16:55.920]  that everything would fall apart. But why does all... and you also, on top of that, so
[16:55.920 -> 16:59.960]  you also have a broader problem which is how difficult it is to assemble good
[16:59.960 -> 17:03.560]  teams. People are constantly being moved, ministers have no control over it. One day
[17:03.560 -> 17:09.320]  you have this one expert on special educational needs funding and then bam, suddenly they're
[17:09.320 -> 17:14.360]  off and they're in charge of the physics GCSE curriculum. It's a completely crazy system
[17:14.360 -> 17:20.400]  over which ministers have absolutely no control. Now you also have a whole set of misaligned
[17:20.400 -> 17:25.860]  incentives. In markets and science you have incentives to push people in certain directions, which
[17:25.860 -> 17:30.040]  are overall healthy and towards correcting errors.
[17:30.040 -> 17:35.560]  In Whitehall, you tend to have unclear goals,
[17:35.560 -> 17:38.280]  and then you have distorting targets that are focused
[17:38.280 -> 17:40.440]  on methods, not on goals.
[17:40.440 -> 17:43.480]  And this encourages huge micromanagement.
[17:43.480 -> 17:47.720]  It means that perverse incentives create all kinds
[17:47.720 -> 17:49.960]  of distortions in the system.
[17:49.960 -> 17:51.880]  And then to cope with that, decisions are sucked
[17:51.880 -> 17:54.720]  all the time upwards to the supposed wise chief
[17:54.720 -> 17:55.960]  at the top of the hierarchy,
[17:55.960 -> 17:58.440]  who's supposed to sort this out.
[17:58.440 -> 18:01.520]  The exact opposite of what happens in healthy organizations.
[18:01.520 -> 18:03.360]  And then of course, it's much easier to fiddle the targets
[18:03.360 -> 18:09.000]  than it is to admit that you've made mistakes in them, partly because the whole system is so opaque.
[18:09.000 -> 18:27.680]  In extremists you end up having peasants melting down ploughs for scrap metal in order to hit steel targets, as happened in Mao's Great Leap Forward. But on a smaller scale you see this sort of problem happening in Whitehall all the time. It's also the case that officials are not incentivized to ask who in the world has
[18:27.680 -> 18:32.360]  already solved this problem and how can we apply this here. A very, what you'd think
[18:32.360 -> 18:36.920]  is a very simple question, but that doesn't really happen in Whitehall, it's very parochial.
[18:36.920 -> 18:41.280]  It's very poor institutional memory, libraries are often being destroyed, so the library
[18:41.280 -> 18:45.200]  in the DFE was destroyed, the library in the Foreign Office was destroyed.
[18:45.200 -> 18:47.600]  Record keeping is often abysmal.
[18:47.600 -> 18:49.380]  So Whitehall ends up being parochial,
[18:49.380 -> 18:51.920]  not just about the outside world, the rest of the world,
[18:51.920 -> 18:53.740]  but also even about its own past.
[18:55.920 -> 18:58.360]  Very few people are incentivized to cut regulation.
[18:58.360 -> 19:01.160]  Incentives push people to create more.
[19:01.160 -> 19:03.440]  There's very, very little incentive on anyone actually ever
[19:03.440 -> 19:05.720]  to get rid of any regulation. There's very little incentive to save on anyone, actually, ever to get rid of any regulation.
[19:05.720 -> 19:07.840]  There's very little incentive to save any money.
[19:07.840 -> 19:09.560]  Treasury does not care about saving money.
[19:09.560 -> 19:12.400]  The Treasury cares about its power over the Whitehall
[19:12.400 -> 19:13.080]  system.
[19:13.080 -> 19:14.880]  And the dodgy account system means
[19:14.880 -> 19:18.400]  that they can hide a huge amount of financial bungling.
[19:18.400 -> 19:21.200]  And the pay system also doesn't incentivize good behavior.
[19:21.200 -> 19:23.400]  There's massive, massive overpayment in the public
[19:23.400 -> 19:27.600]  sector, and actually in the private sector. I think the left won't face it in the public sector and the right
[19:27.600 -> 19:32.320]  won't face it in the private sector. But the whole system is full of people on 70 to 140
[19:32.320 -> 19:36.760]  grand a year who are not worth anything like that money and you could hire a bright 25
[19:36.760 -> 19:42.600]  year old to do a better job faster and cheaper. So what does the civil service incentivise?
[19:42.600 -> 19:46.960]  It fundamentally incentivises an obsessional process,
[19:46.960 -> 19:49.600]  staying friends with special interests,
[19:49.600 -> 19:50.820]  and empire building.
[19:51.800 -> 19:54.120]  I'll probably put your hand up in the room
[19:54.120 -> 19:56.380]  if you've seen the movie The Social Network.
[19:57.920 -> 19:58.880]  Okay, so there's a scene in there
[19:58.880 -> 20:00.400]  where Zuckerberg goes to Palo Alto
[20:00.400 -> 20:02.000]  to try and get his first financing,
[20:02.000 -> 20:03.200]  and there's a scene where you see
[20:03.200 -> 20:05.680]  the legendary venture capitalist Peter Thiel in the room.
[20:05.680 -> 20:06.720]  He only says one sentence.
[20:06.720 -> 20:08.960]  And in fact, in real life, he never said that sentence.
[20:08.960 -> 20:10.000]  But you'll remember the scene where
[20:10.000 -> 20:11.560]  he's in Peter Thiel's office.
[20:11.560 -> 20:14.280]  And the guy turns and says, who's Edward Sabourin?
[20:14.280 -> 20:16.040]  Well, that guy just wrote a book recently.
[20:16.040 -> 20:20.400]  He did a series of lectures to Stanford graduates
[20:20.400 -> 20:21.520]  and wrote a book about it.
[20:21.520 -> 20:23.960]  And in his book, he wrote this.
[20:23.960 -> 20:25.760]  In the most dysfunctional organizations,
[20:25.760 -> 20:27.240]  signaling that work is being done
[20:27.240 -> 20:29.640]  becomes a better strategy for career advancement
[20:29.640 -> 20:31.520]  than actually doing work.
[20:31.520 -> 20:34.160]  If this describes your company, quit now.
[20:35.880 -> 20:39.560]  Now, that describes the vast majority
[20:39.560 -> 20:41.960]  of activity in Whitehall.
[20:41.960 -> 20:46.760]  It's signaling and it's process obsession. It's not obsession on
[20:46.760 -> 20:51.280]  quality, it's not obsession on good services, it's not obsession on trying to
[20:51.280 -> 20:57.140]  get some, on trying to get useful things done. If you look at what how private
[20:57.140 -> 21:00.540]  offices operate, and I spotted at least a couple of people here in private
[21:00.540 -> 21:05.280]  offices, they'll know exactly what I mean. The vast majority of their time is spent on process.
[21:05.280 -> 21:06.760]  And it's extreme.
[21:06.760 -> 21:11.600]  You have situations in which you have got some system,
[21:11.600 -> 21:12.960]  some disaster that's leading the news,
[21:12.960 -> 21:14.640]  people have died because of blah.
[21:14.640 -> 21:16.040]  But the real focus of the system is,
[21:16.040 -> 21:18.840]  why were we not copied in on that email?
[21:18.840 -> 21:21.240]  That's where the system drives everyone
[21:21.240 -> 21:26.440]  to actually obsess on who's CC'd in on the email, not that system's fallen
[21:26.440 -> 21:31.920]  over and all these people haven't got to school or the hospital's collapsed or whatever it
[21:31.920 -> 21:37.640]  might be. You also have misaligned timescales. So lots of these problems involve timescales
[21:37.640 -> 21:43.200]  over many years, which obviously doesn't fit well with career advancement and the way that
[21:43.200 -> 21:47.240]  parliaments work. We're work was told capitalism is extremely short term
[21:47.240 -> 21:49.120]  but if you look at how silicon valley operates
[21:49.120 -> 21:52.000]  the founders of these companies were incentivized to think about more than
[21:52.000 -> 21:53.520]  ten years from now
[21:53.520 -> 21:55.960]  because that's when most the profits of these companies will make
[21:55.960 -> 21:59.100]  most profits from a successful start in silicon valley come after it
[21:59.100 -> 22:00.540]  after a decade
[22:00.540 -> 22:02.320]  so they're actually thinking about that
[22:02.320 -> 22:07.400]  in downing street you're lucky if they're thinking 10 days ahead. So you have very, very big problems
[22:07.400 -> 22:10.720]  regarding time scales.
[22:10.720 -> 22:14.440]  And finally, some basic issues about skills.
[22:14.440 -> 22:19.280]  A lot of people doing policy are not suited for doing policy.
[22:19.280 -> 22:23.840]  The quality of project management in large parts of Whitehall
[22:23.840 -> 22:25.760]  is awful. Project management
[22:25.760 -> 22:32.760]  is not on the SPAD code, but that took more of my time than anything else, just trying
[22:34.120 -> 22:39.600]  to drive projects through the system, because the system itself is not set up to do that
[22:39.600 -> 22:45.120]  well. All sorts of very basic skills have gone the journey, so even just basic correspondence
[22:45.120 -> 22:48.600]  is very hard to get right. When we started off, more than nine out of ten letters were
[22:48.600 -> 22:54.020]  sent back because of basic spelling mistakes. And unfortunately, it was roughly speaking
[22:54.020 -> 22:58.160]  a change from about 2012 onwards, but it was roughly true at the start to assume that every
[22:58.160 -> 23:03.080]  budget you look at will be wrong, every contract process will go wrong, and every procurement
[23:03.080 -> 23:05.140]  will blow up in your face and legal advice
[23:05.140 -> 23:09.500]  will probably be wrong. So if you can't procure things in your own building properly, what
[23:09.500 -> 23:14.220]  are the odds that you're going to procure things effectively for 20,000 schools? The
[23:14.220 -> 23:19.060]  odds are very small and that's why you see constantly, whenever you see the same cycle
[23:19.060 -> 23:23.300]  of inquiry over and over again, why did this go wrong? And the answers are always the same.
[23:23.300 -> 23:27.280]  So and so signed a duff contract, but then so-and-so moved, and then the person in charge says, well,
[23:27.280 -> 23:31.520]  it's not my fault because I wasn't there then, I've taken over this process. And the cycle
[23:31.520 -> 23:36.240]  constantly repeats. If you want to see faces shocked in Whitehall, then when something
[23:36.240 -> 23:40.440]  goes wrong, suggest to them, we want to pursue the people responsible to their new job in
[23:40.440 -> 23:45.760]  a new department. And the reaction is along the lines of oh my god you
[23:45.760 -> 23:49.920]  couldn't do that if we did that where would it all end which just about sums
[23:49.920 -> 23:54.720]  it up. So finally you have so you have all of these individual problems but
[23:54.720 -> 23:59.680]  then lots of them sort of smash together. You have problems with the EU, EU
[23:59.680 -> 24:02.560]  procurement rules things like that, you have problems with European Convention
[24:02.560 -> 24:07.920]  on Human Rights, you have a problem with how internal legal advice is incentivized inside the system.
[24:07.920 -> 24:15.120]  You have civil service, HR, and you have judicial review. And all of these problems interact in very
[24:15.120 -> 24:19.280]  nightmarish ways that make it very difficult to solve things. So you're constantly faced with
[24:19.280 -> 24:31.000]  things that go wrong, that all of those different elements will feed into the problem. And almost none of them do the ministers actually have any really direct control over.
[24:31.000 -> 24:38.000]  So I'll just very briefly talk about, so you have this huge system in Whitehall.
[24:38.000 -> 24:43.000]  In my opinion, it's largely dysfunctional for the various reasons that I've suggested.
[24:43.000 -> 24:46.360]  It's all programmed to go wrong. There's no way it can work.
[24:46.360 -> 24:48.160]  There's no reason to expect it's suddenly
[24:48.160 -> 24:49.240]  going to change tomorrow.
[24:49.240 -> 24:52.440]  How can it?
[24:52.440 -> 24:54.160]  The whole wiring of it means that you're
[24:54.160 -> 24:56.660]  going to keep seeing the same kind of problem over and over
[24:56.660 -> 24:57.640]  again.
[24:57.640 -> 24:59.520]  So you look at the sort of things
[24:59.520 -> 25:02.520]  that this system's going to have to face.
[25:02.520 -> 25:03.960]  In Britain, you've got huge debts.
[25:03.960 -> 25:05.120]  You've got massive
[25:05.120 -> 25:11.720]  wide variation in performance in public services, got huge dependence on the financial sector
[25:11.720 -> 25:17.200]  which is appallingly regulated and programmed to blow up periodically. If you look around
[25:17.200 -> 25:21.760]  the world we've got a familiar issue about a couple of billion Asians joining the economy,
[25:21.760 -> 25:28.160]  but you've also got a couple of billion people about to be born, we're going to be moving into cities. It's going to be, it seems, more
[25:28.160 -> 25:32.480]  cities being built in the next 30 years than the entire building in the whole of human
[25:32.480 -> 25:41.000]  history put together. These people are going to be mobile, which we're already experiencing
[25:41.000 -> 25:48.280]  some of the effects of that. There's going to have huge disruption to existing markets and businesses, huge demands on pension health systems,
[25:48.280 -> 25:52.800]  and huge demands on energy and other resources.
[25:52.800 -> 25:56.200]  At the same time, you have some extremely disruptive
[25:56.200 -> 25:58.680]  technologies hitting from genetic engineering
[25:58.680 -> 26:02.800]  to artificial intelligence, which I won't go into.
[26:02.800 -> 26:08.000]  But overall, you have, it seems to me, a very powerful mismatch.
[26:08.000 -> 26:15.000]  On the one hand you have this scale and complexity of these problems that are hitting the world.
[26:15.000 -> 26:21.000]  On the other hand you have this institutional system and people who are supposed to cope with it.
[26:21.000 -> 26:29.080]  And there's just absolutely no way that these two things, that this combination is not going to produce crises and frequent
[26:29.080 -> 26:36.040]  spectacular failures. So what do we do about it? It seems to me that it's fairly
[26:36.040 -> 26:40.360]  obvious that neither of the political parties, none of the two main political parties
[26:40.360 -> 26:44.480]  now really have a clue what to do. The left won't face the scale of a debt, it
[26:44.480 -> 26:47.440]  won't face the problems of large bureaucracies and all the things that I've just talked about,
[26:48.400 -> 26:55.040]  and it doesn't often have a very good understanding of the amazing ability of markets to solve
[26:55.040 -> 27:00.800]  problems. And the right also has an awful lot of blank spots. It won't face the scale of inequality,
[27:01.440 -> 27:06.200]  problems with financial markets, bloated pay in the private sector, lots of
[27:06.200 -> 27:09.480]  issues like that, the way that the rich cheat in taxes, all of those sorts of things it
[27:09.480 -> 27:11.500]  doesn't want to talk about.
[27:11.500 -> 27:16.400]  It doesn't understand why people are resistant to the spread of markets.
[27:16.400 -> 27:20.200]  And lots of people seem to think, well, can we not just go back to the old world, get
[27:20.200 -> 27:26.720]  out of the EU and put up the borders and go back to a world pre-1914 in which you have
[27:27.440 -> 27:31.200]  mutually antagonistic nation states competing with their national self-interest. That's quite
[27:31.200 -> 27:36.720]  a good world. It doesn't seem to me like a very good world. It seems to me that if you combine
[27:36.720 -> 27:50.000]  the technological... if you combine the pre-1914 world of competing nation states all pursuing their own interests with a technological development, then we're absolutely doomed.
[27:50.000 -> 28:05.200]  So what do I think needs to be done about it? First of all, I would argue that we need to think very carefully about our national goal. Dean Acheson, the US Secretary of State,
[28:05.200 -> 28:09.920]  famously said after World War II that Britain had lost its empire but hadn't found a role,
[28:09.920 -> 28:16.320]  and that remains true. We're grumpy in the EU but won't leave, we're rude about it,
[28:17.920 -> 28:25.160]  and the whole process has become embarrassing. I don't think the answer is either the special
[28:25.160 -> 28:31.040]  relationship or return to pre-1914 or the EU. What I would suggest is that our
[28:31.040 -> 28:34.400]  role should focus on making ourselves the leading country in the world for
[28:34.400 -> 28:39.200]  education and science. Pericles described Athens as the school of Greece and we
[28:39.200 -> 28:42.160]  could be the school of the world. We've already got many advantages, we've got
[28:42.160 -> 28:47.460]  brilliant universities, we've got some of the best schools in the world. This would provide an organising principle for
[28:47.460 -> 28:52.400]  a new policy agenda and it would focus resources. It would give us a central role in building
[28:52.400 -> 28:57.460]  new international institutions that we need. It would require and enable fundamental changes
[28:57.460 -> 29:02.740]  to how the Constitution and Westminster and Whitehall all work. And it's a noble goal
[29:02.740 -> 29:08.280]  that reflects the best in human nature and therefore I think it could transcend a lot of differences and get a lot of support
[29:08.280 -> 29:16.920]  from people of very different politics. So that's the first thing, a goal, a
[29:16.920 -> 29:20.800]  national goal of making ourselves the leading country for education science.
[29:20.800 -> 29:29.640]  Secondly, more specifically, I think that there are all sorts of things that need to change inside the education system, but one in particular is for leading politicians
[29:29.640 -> 29:35.080]  and officials. We need what the guy who discovered the quark, the physicist Murray Gell-Mann,
[29:35.080 -> 29:39.840]  called an Edisonian education, something that integrates knowledge from maths and science
[29:39.840 -> 29:45.080]  on the one hand, from the humanities and social sciences on the other hand, and training in effective action.
[29:45.080 -> 29:48.960]  The current systems, as I discussed, I think don't work,
[29:48.960 -> 29:50.240]  and we need new ones.
[29:50.240 -> 29:54.440]  We need new degrees instead of replacing things like PPE.
[29:54.440 -> 29:56.600]  There are various experiments and interesting developments
[29:56.600 -> 29:57.760]  happening with this already.
[29:57.760 -> 29:59.440]  Tetlock, the guy who I mentioned earlier,
[29:59.440 -> 30:01.560]  who did all this work on expert judgment
[30:01.560 -> 30:04.000]  and why it's terrible, is doing a fascinating thing
[30:04.000 -> 30:08.680]  in America now, working actually with the US intelligence agency,
[30:08.680 -> 30:11.860]  but I think most of the work is in the public domain,
[30:11.860 -> 30:13.620]  called the Good Judgment Project,
[30:13.620 -> 30:16.620]  which involves systematic attempt to try and train people
[30:16.620 -> 30:18.380]  in different cognitive methods
[30:18.380 -> 30:20.520]  that will improve judgments.
[30:20.520 -> 30:24.080]  And lots of it's relatively simple stuff,
[30:24.080 -> 30:29.000]  and it's had dramatic results, much more dramatic results than people ever thought was possible
[30:29.000 -> 30:32.000]  and I think that's very encouraging.
[30:32.000 -> 30:36.000]  So that's item two.
[30:36.000 -> 30:47.800]  Third, in terms of institutions, at the moment our institutions are not focusing expert attention on the important problems. The most obvious example is in the financial markets.
[30:47.800 -> 30:54.300]  We have the cleverest people in the world educated at vast expense by the taxpayer in
[30:54.300 -> 31:01.280]  maths and physics, and then we funnel them into high-frequency algorithmic trading systems,
[31:01.280 -> 31:10.000]  which is where a massive number of them now are getting sucked into. It's an absolutely crazy mismatch between the importance of the problem for humanity
[31:10.000 -> 31:14.000]  and the nature of the people that we're pushing into it.
[31:14.000 -> 31:18.000]  So we need to change how institutions work so that they're actually incentivising
[31:18.000 -> 31:21.000]  the cleverest people, the most able problem solvers, to look at the problems
[31:21.000 -> 31:31.840]  which we know are the most important. And I'll finish just by talking briefly about some specific changes to Whitehall.
[31:31.840 -> 31:34.380]  The first is a sort of mass refocusing.
[31:34.380 -> 31:38.880]  So when Steve Jobs came back into Apple when it was nearly bankrupt in the mid-90s, the
[31:38.880 -> 31:41.840]  first thing he did was bin a massive amount of what they were doing.
[31:41.840 -> 31:46.200]  He came in, said, right, you've got 30 different computers. There's going to be four computers.
[31:46.200 -> 31:47.280]  We're not doing printers.
[31:47.280 -> 31:47.960]  We're not doing this.
[31:47.960 -> 31:48.480]  We're not doing that.
[31:48.480 -> 31:49.560]  We're not doing the other.
[31:49.560 -> 31:50.800]  All closed immediately.
[31:50.800 -> 31:53.640]  And he shut it down and had ruthless simplification
[31:53.640 -> 31:55.040]  and ruthless focus.
[31:55.040 -> 31:56.840]  And that's the sort of process that
[31:56.840 -> 31:58.040]  needs to happen in Whitehall.
[31:58.040 -> 32:04.720]  It's totally disincentivized now inside the system.
[32:04.720 -> 32:08.520]  Secondly, you need to think about how to reorient Whitehall to think about how to
[32:08.520 -> 32:09.920]  incentivize goals
[32:09.920 -> 32:13.160]  not micromanage methods. So if you look at what's
[32:13.160 -> 32:16.360]  arguably the most successful bit of bureaucracy in the Western world in the last
[32:16.360 -> 32:17.520]  40 years is DARPA,
[32:17.520 -> 32:21.600]  Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, which built the internet and stole fighters and what not.
[32:21.600 -> 32:26.440]  Some interesting features about how it works. It's totally outside all normal Washington rules
[32:26.440 -> 32:29.280]  of procurement, HR, et cetera, et cetera.
[32:30.400 -> 32:32.200]  And it doesn't have its own labs.
[32:32.200 -> 32:33.800]  What it has is it has goals,
[32:33.800 -> 32:35.560]  and it hires people in specific labs
[32:35.560 -> 32:37.000]  to do specific things.
[32:37.000 -> 32:39.280]  And then it very ruthlessly calls after a few years
[32:39.280 -> 32:43.160]  and says failure, stop, success, reinforce.
[32:43.160 -> 32:45.540]  So we know that there are ways in which we can change
[32:45.540 -> 32:50.720]  how bureaucracies work to have much high performance than they currently have.
[32:50.720 -> 32:55.920]  Third, a very simple thing, is we just need to massively reduce the number of
[32:55.920 -> 33:01.040]  people in the system. When we said in the DfE we're going to reduce it, everyone
[33:01.040 -> 33:06.200]  said oh my god the whole system will fall apart. But in fact, getting rid of thousands of people
[33:06.200 -> 33:10.280]  in the DfE system improved performance considerably.
[33:10.280 -> 33:13.560]  I'm absolutely convinced that if you cut the DfE by another half
[33:13.560 -> 33:17.520]  or even more, ideally, it would also improve and I think that's true
[33:17.520 -> 33:18.080]  across
[33:18.080 -> 33:21.240]  Whitehall. Fourth,
[33:21.240 -> 33:24.360]  this whole human resources system
[33:24.360 -> 33:26.000]  currently makes it impossible to hire,
[33:26.000 -> 33:31.000]  fire, and train people intelligently. The whole system needs to be binned.
[33:31.000 -> 33:41.000]  Fifth, end the concept of the permanent civil service in general. I think it's an idea for the history books.
[33:41.000 -> 33:44.000]  In particular, I would get rid of the idea of permanent secretaries.
[33:44.000 -> 33:48.720]  At the moment, a permanent secretary has a role that's a combination of a chief policy officer,
[33:48.720 -> 33:54.240]  a chief policy advisor, a department CEO, and a fixer. And it's a crazy combination. You're
[33:54.240 -> 33:59.600]  asking people to have the skills of Michael Quinlan, the famous official at the Ministry
[33:59.600 -> 34:05.600]  of Defence to draft policy, combined with the skills of Bill Gates, combined with a Machiavellian character
[34:05.600 -> 34:10.480]  to make everything just smooth out of the edges all day every day as things just about teeter off
[34:10.480 -> 34:15.520]  the off the brink. It's crazy to expect that we're going to find all these people that combine all of
[34:15.520 -> 34:20.320]  the all of these three things. It's misdefining the role. So what you should have here is a chief
[34:20.320 -> 34:25.960]  policy officer for the department and I think it would be good to have a very, very, very
[34:25.960 -> 34:28.320]  small team that fulfills that role,
[34:28.320 -> 34:30.600]  preserves institutional memory, has proper libraries,
[34:30.600 -> 34:32.360]  runs proper records.
[34:32.360 -> 34:35.200]  But this chief policy advisor, who I think
[34:35.200 -> 34:37.640]  should be a very prestigious role and a well-paid role,
[34:37.640 -> 34:39.720]  should have no responsibility for management
[34:39.720 -> 34:40.920]  and implementation.
[34:40.920 -> 34:44.480]  They're a policy advisor only.
[34:44.480 -> 34:49.360]  And move all the idea of a CEO or COO of the
[34:49.360 -> 34:56.800]  organization to a completely different position. Next, the unglamorous
[34:56.800 -> 35:00.960]  process of rebuilding core skills from correspondence to spreadsheets. Whitehall's
[35:00.960 -> 35:07.100]  MPs and officials are constantly giving the rest of the world advice on skills
[35:07.100 -> 35:12.720]  gaps and what they should do about it. It needs to start looking at its own skills gaps.
[35:12.720 -> 35:16.760]  Next I think number 10 should, the whole Cabinet Office structure and the number 10 structure
[35:16.760 -> 35:21.200]  is completely broken. Anyone who has to deal with it knows that the system is absolutely
[35:21.200 -> 35:28.000]  dysfunctional and that has to change very, very significantly. Next, open things up very radically.
[35:28.000 -> 35:32.000]  You see in the science world now, mass collaborations have
[35:32.000 -> 35:36.000]  changing all sorts of things, from things like polymath, where you now
[35:36.000 -> 35:40.000]  have mathematicians solving problems collaboratively, or the
[35:40.000 -> 35:44.000]  Foldit program on PlayStation. There's all sorts of things which are changing
[35:44.000 -> 35:45.760]  the world in science
[35:45.760 -> 35:52.800]  and tools that are being developed. Those tools and those methods should be imported into Whitehall.
[35:54.320 -> 35:58.320]  Next, greater cognitive diversity. The Prime Minister should be able to appoint whoever he
[35:58.320 -> 36:01.840]  wants as a minister. And there's a very simple mechanism, I think, for doing this. You whack
[36:01.840 -> 36:07.600]  them in the House of Lords and then you give Lords rights of audience in the House of Commons and you strengthen
[36:07.600 -> 36:13.800]  the select committee process. And I understand having talked to some old timers in the House
[36:13.800 -> 36:17.300]  of Lords that you could maybe do this very, very quickly. So that would be on my to-do
[36:17.300 -> 36:22.040]  list if I ever managed to successfully get control of Number 10. One of the first things
[36:22.040 -> 36:30.880]  I would do would be some orders in council whizzed through at 2am that gave the Prime Minister the right to do this. So on
[36:30.880 -> 36:33.360]  the one hand bringing people from wherever and making them ministers, bucking them in
[36:33.360 -> 36:39.000]  the House of Lords, which would help as well with the division and have the legislature
[36:39.000 -> 36:46.400]  far more just as a legislature. And bringing the other aspect that needs to be embedded much more
[36:46.400 -> 36:50.240]  carefully is scientific advisors and the whole business of evidence-based policy.
[36:50.240 -> 36:54.440]  That needs to be put at the heart of how Secretaries of State operate rather than
[36:54.440 -> 36:59.440]  an add-on or like in the EU something which you can just simply abolish if
[36:59.440 -> 37:03.000]  you don't like it. You've got to shrink the cabinet, I've almost finished don't worry.
[37:03.000 -> 37:08.000]  Shrink the cabinet, the idea of a cabinet of over 30 people is complete farce.
[37:08.000 -> 37:11.000]  It should be maximum of probably six or seven people.
[37:11.000 -> 37:13.000]  Break the power of the treasury.
[37:13.000 -> 37:17.000]  The treasury, as I said before, doesn't care about saving money.
[37:17.000 -> 37:20.000]  The government account system is based on funding money.
[37:20.000 -> 37:24.000]  The spending review process does not work at all.
[37:24.000 -> 37:28.160]  And I think the next spending review, if they try and do another spending review process does not work at all. And I think the next spending review, if they try and do another spending review with the
[37:28.160 -> 37:33.920]  current conventional process, given the numbers that they face, is going to be an absolute
[37:33.920 -> 37:38.840]  nightmare for whoever tries to do it.
[37:38.840 -> 37:42.920]  And finally, Warren Buffett proposed something very interesting in the corporate world, which
[37:42.920 -> 37:49.080]  I think we should think about. He was talking about the problem whereby egomaniac CEOs pursue
[37:49.080 -> 37:52.120]  takeovers of businesses because they get massive kickbacks
[37:52.120 -> 37:53.640]  from it personally.
[37:53.640 -> 37:55.760]  And he said, it appears to me there's
[37:55.760 -> 37:58.800]  only one way to get a rational and balanced discussion.
[37:58.800 -> 38:00.600]  Directors should hire a second advisor
[38:00.600 -> 38:03.080]  to make the case against the proposed acquisition
[38:03.080 -> 38:11.760]  with a fee contingent on the deal not going through. This seems to me to be an extremely cunning idea and something like
[38:11.760 -> 38:16.440]  that is, proper red teams in Whitehall that are institutionalized, that can't be easily
[38:16.440 -> 38:22.120]  cheated because the CIA famously closed down its red team on WMD in Iraq, so these things
[38:22.120 -> 38:33.320]  are very hard to do in politics, but I think we need to think about changes to the system like that. So that's it. In summary, my answer to the
[38:33.320 -> 38:40.000]  problems is the national goal is not special relationship and it's not the EU. It's making
[38:40.000 -> 38:44.320]  Britain the leader for education and science. We need to reorient Whitehall in order to
[38:44.320 -> 38:49.380]  achieve this. We need very different education and training for senior politicians and civil
[38:49.380 -> 38:53.880]  servants. We need to bin some institutions, create others, but make them more like the
[38:53.880 -> 38:59.080]  immune system than like traditional hierarchies. We need to break the concept of the permanent
[38:59.080 -> 39:06.400]  civil service and open things up to genuine problem solvers. Now people will say it's impossible to do this,
[39:06.400 -> 39:08.320]  but people told me that lots of things are possible.
[39:08.320 -> 39:10.280]  People said you'll never beat Blair on the Euro.
[39:10.280 -> 39:12.360]  People said you'll never get more than a fraction
[39:12.360 -> 39:15.000]  of your crazy plans through the DFE.
[39:15.000 -> 39:17.200]  Things are possible, and particularly possible
[39:17.200 -> 39:18.600]  when crises hit.
[39:18.600 -> 39:20.360]  Monet created the whole EU pretty much
[39:20.360 -> 39:23.560]  on the basis of what he called beneficial crises.
[39:23.560 -> 39:25.280]  And because of the nature of the world
[39:25.280 -> 39:27.200]  and where things are going, I think
[39:27.200 -> 39:30.040]  we're going to be seeing lots of beneficial crises shortly,
[39:30.040 -> 39:33.000]  which will enable us to change things along the lines
[39:33.000 -> 39:35.280]  that I've suggested, if you want to.
[39:35.280 -> 39:47.000]  Thank you. Many thanks indeed Dominic, that was incredibly interesting.
[39:47.000 -> 39:56.400]  I'm going to start with, if I may, with a question really, which is about how this change
[39:56.400 -> 39:57.400]  would happen.
[39:57.400 -> 40:02.840]  I mean, you opened your remarks by saying whether Ed Miliband or David Cameron becomes
[40:02.840 -> 40:09.000]  Prime Minister in May, you know, nothing will change, and you ended with a very radical agenda for a set of big changes.
[40:09.000 -> 40:13.000]  I suppose the question back to you then is where does politics come into this?
[40:13.000 -> 40:19.000]  What are the mechanisms by which the sorts of things you're advocating for could actually happen?
[40:19.000 -> 40:23.000]  That is a very tricky question.
[40:23.000 -> 40:27.920]  As I said, I'm not enormously hopeful with the current people.
[40:27.920 -> 40:30.120]  But the British system is so flexible,
[40:30.120 -> 40:32.920]  and I think the scale of the crisis is so big,
[40:32.920 -> 40:35.640]  that some sort of change is going to happen.
[40:35.640 -> 40:40.280]  I personally think it's possible that both leaders will be gone
[40:40.280 -> 40:42.920]  within the next 18 months, or all three leaders will
[40:42.920 -> 40:44.840]  be gone in the next 18 months.
[40:44.840 -> 40:46.240]  They're all visibly failing.
[40:46.240 -> 40:48.080]  None of them can make any progress.
[40:48.080 -> 40:49.560]  None of them know what to do.
[40:49.560 -> 40:52.240]  Everyone outside a very closed world
[40:52.240 -> 40:54.120]  knows the system is knackered.
[40:54.120 -> 40:57.200]  So you've got very, very powerful conditions
[40:57.200 -> 40:59.320]  for things to change.
[40:59.320 -> 41:04.880]  It only needs, I don't think, partly because the system is
[41:04.880 -> 41:06.040]  so centralized in England.
[41:06.040 -> 41:08.660]  I think in a way, actually, it's much harder to change America
[41:08.660 -> 41:11.080]  because of the very deliberate checks and balances built
[41:11.080 -> 41:14.120]  in, hardwired into the system by the founding fathers.
[41:14.120 -> 41:17.480]  But I think here, the system is so flexible and so oddly
[41:17.480 -> 41:20.760]  centralized that if a group of people
[41:20.760 -> 41:22.480]  did take over one of the main parties,
[41:22.480 -> 41:23.980]  well, there's two office mechanisms.
[41:23.980 -> 41:25.720]  One is a group of people take over a party
[41:25.720 -> 41:29.120]  and very radically change what they're doing.
[41:29.120 -> 41:31.920]  I think because the system is the way it is,
[41:31.920 -> 41:35.880]  you could actually change an awful lot very quickly.
[41:35.880 -> 41:38.720]  And the second is outside competition.
[41:38.720 -> 41:40.480]  Now, obviously, part of the vicious circle
[41:40.480 -> 41:42.480]  is that outside competition is very hard.
[41:42.480 -> 41:45.080]  It's very hard for new people to break in.
[41:45.080 -> 41:46.440]  But it's not impossible.
[41:46.440 -> 41:48.360]  And one of the effects, possibly,
[41:48.360 -> 41:51.040]  if you get the Greens coming up, is
[41:51.040 -> 41:55.560]  going to be to force everyone in Westminster to re-evaluate.
[41:55.560 -> 41:58.840]  So will things change in the next year?
[41:58.840 -> 42:00.280]  No, I'm not very hopeful.
[42:00.280 -> 42:03.200]  But I think in the next five years,
[42:03.200 -> 42:06.000]  I think just the scale of all of these pressures is such that
[42:06.000 -> 42:13.680]  somebody's going to have to give. Let me just ask you a follow-up question. When you worked for
[42:13.680 -> 42:18.920]  Michael Gove, you spoke about your experiences in the DfE. Many people, whether you agree with what
[42:18.920 -> 42:25.360]  he did or not, many people would say that he distinguished himself as a minister in this government by having an
[42:25.360 -> 42:31.960]  agenda and prosecuting an agenda. What is it about Michael Gove or the things that you
[42:31.960 -> 42:37.200]  decided to do in your government that made him happen? Why was he the minister that he
[42:37.200 -> 42:38.200]  was in education?
[42:38.200 -> 42:46.000]  It's a complicated question. It starts with, I suppose, personally. He's an adopted kid, Mae'n cwestiwn cymhwyseddol. Mae'n dechrau gan y cyhoedd yn ei ben. Mae'n plant yn cael ei adnabod,
[42:46.000 -> 42:49.000]  mae'n gwybod beth ydyn nhw wedi'i wneud neu ddim.
[42:49.000 -> 42:52.000]  Nid yw'n ddiwrnod mai'n meddwl
[42:52.000 -> 42:55.000]  y byddai bywyd fy Michael Gove
[42:55.000 -> 42:57.000]  yn gwahanol o'n i.
[42:57.000 -> 42:59.000]  Nid oedd yn cydnabod am fy nghyfraith,
[42:59.000 -> 43:01.000]  nid oedd yn dweud i mi bod yn ysgol iawn,
[43:01.000 -> 43:03.000]  ond oedd yn meddwl am ei bywyd ei hun,
[43:03.000 -> 43:06.480]  ac mae'n gwneud iddo feddwl yn anodd iawn am y system. what on earth would have happened to me. He thought about that about his own life I think and that made him think very hard about
[43:06.480 -> 43:09.640]  the system overall. So I think that's
[43:09.640 -> 43:12.720]  relatively unusual probably in Westminster.
[43:12.720 -> 43:16.400]  He was extremely highly motivated. Secondly he was
[43:16.400 -> 43:21.360]  prepared, his view was that he was happier
[43:21.360 -> 43:24.920]  he was much more interested in having an
[43:24.920 -> 43:26.400]  impact, doing what he could to improve schools than he was much more interested in having an impact, in doing what he could
[43:26.400 -> 43:30.120]  to improve schools, than he was in having a successful political career.
[43:30.120 -> 43:36.200]  So his approach was, I don't mind if at the end of four or five years' time, I'm gone
[43:36.200 -> 43:38.400]  and that's the end of me.
[43:38.400 -> 43:43.640]  If you've achieved a considerable amount of what you want to achieve, then the thing will
[43:43.640 -> 43:44.640]  be worth it.
[43:44.640 -> 43:48.360]  And thirdly, we built a team who had the same attitude.
[43:48.360 -> 43:51.800]  All of us wanted to be MPs, all of us were interested in making friends in Downing Street
[43:51.800 -> 43:52.800]  or anywhere else.
[43:52.800 -> 43:58.360]  And I think that gave us a lot of freedom just to put our foot down and do what was
[43:58.360 -> 44:00.800]  possible because our attitude was, what's the worst that could happen?
[44:00.800 -> 44:02.800]  The worst that could happen is you get fired, so what?
[44:02.800 -> 44:06.480]  We don't care about that, So why not? Why not try?
[44:06.480 -> 44:07.480]  Very, very interesting.
[44:07.480 -> 44:10.520]  I think you certainly scored on that last point about not
[44:10.520 -> 44:12.680]  needing or wanting to make friends
[44:12.680 -> 44:15.840]  with other politicians in other bits of Whitehall.
[44:15.840 -> 44:20.360]  But I want to now open up to some questions from the floor.
[44:20.360 -> 44:23.080]  I think we have a microphone, a roving microphone.
[44:23.080 -> 44:27.440]  If you could say who you are, that would be great. I think we need a bit of a mic down here. This isn't…
[44:27.440 -> 44:32.560]  Can you hear us? Yeah, actually, it'd be best if you go to the back. Yes. Oh, it is
[44:32.560 -> 44:37.240]  working. Okay, so say who you are and where you're from, and then put your questions.
[44:37.240 -> 44:41.640]  So, gentlemen here first, yeah.
[44:41.640 -> 44:44.840]  Just to ask you…
[44:44.840 -> 44:45.800]  Just say who you are first.
[44:45.800 -> 44:48.200]  Yes, sorry, wrong letter. I'm from the Open University.
[44:48.200 -> 44:52.000]  Just to ask you, sorry, could you…
[44:52.000 -> 44:54.800]  That's it. Okay, thank you very much indeed.
[44:54.800 -> 44:58.000]  About procure, you said something about procurement,
[44:58.000 -> 45:01.800]  and I think that's such an important issue because there's so much of it going on.
[45:01.800 -> 45:03.800]  Can you say a bit more about what the problems are?
[45:03.800 -> 45:05.600]  And the other thing I wanted to ask you,
[45:05.600 -> 45:07.600]  and we can go on very quickly, is,
[45:07.600 -> 45:11.800]  is what you're saying many policies that are developed by politicians
[45:11.800 -> 45:15.600]  are actually experiments, but they're presented as solutions
[45:15.600 -> 45:17.200]  rather than actual experiments,
[45:17.200 -> 45:18.800]  and that's the way we should actually look at it?
[45:18.800 -> 45:20.600]  That's what I'm trying to get at.
[45:20.600 -> 45:22.400]  Sorry, could you say that second bit again?
[45:22.400 -> 45:24.800]  The second bit is whether a lot of the policies
[45:24.800 -> 45:28.400]  that politicians are presenting to us and
[45:28.400 -> 45:32.880]  saying this is the answer, we have the answer, that they're actually no more than experiments
[45:32.880 -> 45:37.040]  because of the whole complexity of the system that you were talking about at the beginning.
[45:37.040 -> 45:40.280]  But I particularly like to hear what you've got to say about procurement and the problems
[45:40.280 -> 45:41.280]  there.
[45:41.280 -> 45:48.000]  Okay, on the procurement front, there's a combination of things.
[45:48.000 -> 45:53.440]  So on the one hand you have national systems devised in Whitehall which are very complicated
[45:53.440 -> 45:55.380]  and don't work very well.
[45:55.380 -> 46:01.080]  You also have the fact that on almost all the important things the rules are actually
[46:01.080 -> 46:03.360]  EU controlled, not national.
[46:03.360 -> 46:06.520]  So you have Whitehall systems that don't work very well.
[46:06.520 -> 46:08.160]  On top of that, you have EU systems
[46:08.160 -> 46:10.480]  that are very complicated.
[46:10.480 -> 46:11.760]  You have all the traditional problems
[46:11.760 -> 46:14.620]  with how the civil service gold plates things.
[46:14.620 -> 46:18.080]  You have another problem, which is huge risk aversion
[46:18.980 -> 46:20.600]  and legal advice.
[46:20.600 -> 46:24.560]  So you have very complex system A, national,
[46:24.560 -> 46:30.560]  very complex system B, EU, legal advice about both, which will probably be wrong.
[46:32.840 -> 46:37.240]  You have civil servants who are incentivised not to take risks.
[46:37.440 -> 46:42.720]  So it's a black mark if, say, you get an infraction letter from the European Commission.
[46:44.080 -> 46:47.680]  And you have all of the standard problems with how Whitehall struggles to introduce
[46:47.680 -> 46:51.400]  EU legislation and then you have judicial review
[46:51.400 -> 46:55.640]  problems on top of that. So you'll often have
[46:55.640 -> 47:00.840]  I had involving actually one of the people in this room, but I won't say who,
[47:00.840 -> 47:07.620]  a procurement process in which they were spat out as the winners of the procurement process and then we were given legal advice that said if you
[47:07.620 -> 47:12.160]  carry on and give them the project you'll be judicially reviewed and you'll lose. If you
[47:12.160 -> 47:16.320]  stop and redo it you'll be judicially reviewed and lose. If you pause you'll be
[47:16.320 -> 47:19.680]  judicially reviewed and lose. Whatever you do you're going to be JR'd and you're going to lose.
[47:19.680 -> 47:27.800]  And that's the kind of minefield that you're stuck with and that happens very very
[47:27.800 -> 47:31.760]  routinely and then when you dig into it you find the people that signed it
[47:31.760 -> 47:35.640]  have usually gone, well first of all they weren't experts in the process in the first place
[47:35.640 -> 47:38.960]  so you've got non-experts dealing with very technical issues then they've gone off
[47:38.960 -> 47:42.760]  to take another job somewhere else so the person now in charge of it says well
[47:42.760 -> 47:46.960]  it wasn't me, I don't really know why this was done, obviously it's stupid but you can't blame me for it. So you have all these
[47:46.960 -> 47:52.640]  things, you have HR, judicial review, legal advice going wrong, national, EU, you have
[47:52.640 -> 47:57.560]  all these different things interacting in ways which no one really has the authority
[47:57.560 -> 48:02.220]  to break out of. The Secretary of State can't say, the most that we did really to break
[48:02.220 -> 48:05.040]  out of this problem was to just go and hire top-notch
[48:05.040 -> 48:06.040]  lawyers from outside.
[48:06.040 -> 48:10.280]  Almost the only budget, if not the only budget we increased in the DfE was the lawyer budget
[48:10.280 -> 48:15.360]  because it was much easier to go and just hire the absolute top-notch specialist on
[48:15.360 -> 48:19.640]  some branch of EU law, get a decision like that.
[48:19.640 -> 48:25.700]  But also from someone who could say, we could task and say our goal is to achieve X, give us
[48:25.700 -> 48:29.700]  legal advice that we can use in an argument with the European Commission and the rest
[48:29.700 -> 48:34.620]  of Whitehall that will enable us to do X. Ah right, here's your legal advice, this is
[48:34.620 -> 48:39.020]  why X is arguably legal, right thanks very much, off we go, this is why we're going to
[48:39.020 -> 48:43.660]  go ahead and do that. And that was a very important tool, without that an awful lot
[48:43.660 -> 48:49.280]  of things that we wanted to do would have been blown up on the launch pad because someone would have said, people
[48:49.280 -> 48:53.680]  did say all the time, that's illegal. Very simple things, sorry I'm starting off point,
[48:53.680 -> 49:02.080]  so I'll shut up there. Your point about experiments, I don't really understand what you mean.
[49:02.080 -> 49:06.400]  If you mean are they sort of accidentally experimenting, you don't really understand what you mean. If you mean are they sort of accidentally experimenting, you don't really understand what they're doing, then yes
[49:06.400 -> 49:13.220]  that's true in various ways. I think it would be better probably if people were
[49:13.220 -> 49:17.940]  more explicit about experiments when they're doing it and said we don't know
[49:17.940 -> 49:21.700]  what the answer to this is, therefore we're going to experiment and if it
[49:21.700 -> 49:28.440]  works and here's a robust way of evaluating it, we'll press on and if we don't do it, then we'll immediately bin it and the people involved in the project
[49:28.440 -> 49:32.600]  will stop being involved and stop being paid. That's how DARPA works, why DARPA is such
[49:32.600 -> 49:36.760]  a success. It doesn't create these institutions that then have a bureaucratic life of their
[49:36.760 -> 49:40.360]  own which just keeps saying, oh well, just keep funding us forever and then they become
[49:40.360 -> 49:42.160]  permanent parts of the system.
[49:42.160 -> 49:45.720]  Okay, so I'll take a few if I may.
[49:45.720 -> 49:46.800]  Sure.
[49:46.800 -> 49:48.320]  So, quite at the back, then Julian,
[49:48.320 -> 49:49.160]  and then the gentleman at the front.
[49:49.160 -> 49:50.760]  So, three questions, yeah.
[49:54.240 -> 49:56.000]  Thanks, really interesting talk, Dominic.
[49:56.000 -> 49:58.160]  Daniel Crammond from King's College London.
[49:58.800 -> 50:02.960]  So, I was keen sort of observer of your sort of time in DfE,
[50:02.960 -> 50:04.760]  in my old role, and one of the things
[50:04.760 -> 50:05.060]  that I thought
[50:05.060 -> 50:09.340]  was really interesting was when Michael started to kind of get real traction was when he got
[50:09.340 -> 50:13.620]  the right people appointed to lead certain reviews, people that he could trust to get
[50:13.620 -> 50:14.620]  on the…
[50:14.620 -> 50:15.620]  Certain reviews you say?
[50:15.620 -> 50:18.460]  Certain reviews of the key sort of policy, you know, the key policy frameworks where
[50:18.460 -> 50:22.700]  you actually needed to make changes, you needed to make the case for it. So people like Alison
[50:22.700 -> 50:25.400]  Wolf for example with vocational education.
[50:25.400 -> 50:27.600]  Getting the right people appointed
[50:27.600 -> 50:30.160]  from that external world is really important.
[50:30.160 -> 50:31.680]  But the other thing that I think Michael did
[50:31.680 -> 50:34.960]  that was really interesting is his non-executive directors
[50:34.960 -> 50:37.520]  for the department board and some of the other,
[50:37.520 -> 50:40.000]  so that Ned sort of role within Whitehall,
[50:40.000 -> 50:42.520]  the challenge that provided to the department,
[50:42.520 -> 50:44.240]  but also more informally,
[50:44.240 -> 50:46.360]  the way that he was able to leverage expertise from certain head teachers to come in and challenge that provided to the department, but also more informally, the way that he was able to leverage expertise
[50:46.360 -> 50:48.000]  from certain head teachers to come in
[50:48.000 -> 50:51.320]  and challenge that conventional thinking was really good.
[50:51.320 -> 50:54.960]  Why do you think that doesn't happen more widely in Whitehall
[50:54.960 -> 50:58.200]  and what do you think are the ways to unblocking it?
[50:58.200 -> 51:01.360]  Because I look at most of the other NED structures
[51:01.360 -> 51:03.480]  in Whitehall departments and you don't have
[51:03.480 -> 51:09.580]  that same caliber of people as the John Nash's that were coming in, the Theodore Agnew's, it's not so attractive
[51:09.580 -> 51:13.160]  to get people coming in and being part of Whitehall departments. It tends to be people
[51:13.160 -> 51:17.420]  as well often at the very end of their career who often played it safe.
[51:17.420 -> 51:21.340]  Yeah, okay, thanks very much. And then Julian McRae here.
[51:21.340 -> 51:25.160]  I'm Julian McRae from the Institute for Government.
[51:25.160 -> 51:29.800]  I came into Whitehall about ten years into my career, so there were various things you
[51:29.800 -> 51:33.480]  were throwing out there which were really reminiscent of the obsession with CC lists
[51:33.480 -> 51:39.000]  which is very bizarre when I got there and I became totally minded of it when you were
[51:39.000 -> 51:40.000]  in.
[51:40.000 -> 51:45.920]  I'm just really interested in two of the sort of changes that you picked out.
[51:45.920 -> 51:48.600]  One was around Treasury and the spending review.
[51:48.600 -> 51:52.260]  I think most people who look at this know that you cannot run that spending review process
[51:52.260 -> 51:56.640]  in the same way again, including I think some people in Treasury.
[51:56.640 -> 52:01.280]  But they're really struggling to articulate what actually should we do, how can we run
[52:01.280 -> 52:05.520]  it, given the real constraints of politics that play into spending reviews.
[52:05.520 -> 52:09.600]  So just be interested in your thoughts of what's a solution to that.
[52:09.600 -> 52:14.920]  The second one, a lot of the quality at least in the policy making side, Chris Wormald,
[52:14.920 -> 52:19.760]  the DFE at PermSec, is leading a lot of work across the civil service at the moment to
[52:19.760 -> 52:22.080]  try and increase the quality of policy making module.
[52:22.080 -> 52:27.160]  I'm just interested in what your thoughts were about what Chris is doing. Is that the right direction? Is it kind of missing the
[52:27.160 -> 52:29.120]  point? And what do you think about that?
[52:29.120 -> 52:33.200]  Okay, thank you, Julie. And then the gentleman at the front here.
[52:33.200 -> 52:39.600]  George Jones, I agree very much with what I think your main theme, that British government
[52:39.600 -> 52:46.960]  is over-centralized, that the centre can't deal with the complexity and you need to decentralize to
[52:46.960 -> 53:00.000]  hubs. Two points, you said that we all know that the cabinet office number 10 link is dysfunctional
[53:00.000 -> 53:05.200]  but I'm afraid we don't all know because that's one of the hidden areas.
[53:05.200 -> 53:10.160]  So I wonder if you could spell out what are the dysfunctional aspects of that relationship.
[53:11.040 -> 53:17.920]  Secondly, if you're so much in favor of hubs, decentralized hubs,
[53:17.920 -> 53:27.900]  why did Mr Gove and you at DfE undermine elected local government, which did offer the possibility of being
[53:27.900 -> 53:30.320]  a decentralized hub in our system.
[53:30.320 -> 53:35.520]  Okay, thank you very much.
[53:35.520 -> 53:36.020]  Okay.
[53:38.020 -> 53:43.800]  So the first question, yesterday, importance of bringing people in like,
[53:43.800 -> 53:46.160]  like Alison and also the NEDs.
[53:46.160 -> 53:49.520]  Other people have said to me that the way that our NEDs worked was no one else
[53:49.520 -> 53:53.560]  really has done the same thing. I don't know if that's true or not, but
[53:53.560 -> 53:57.520]  certainly they were extremely important. I think probably the main
[53:57.520 -> 54:02.800]  aspects of it are just very simple really. They were determined
[54:02.800 -> 54:06.240]  people and high quality people but also we made
[54:06.240 -> 54:10.960]  clear to the department that we expected senior officials to work closely with
[54:10.960 -> 54:16.880]  them and we gave them specific things to do. So in many ways our NEDs were
[54:16.880 -> 54:21.440]  almost like more other junior ministers. They were obviously not called that but
[54:21.440 -> 54:28.640]  in lots of ways they are particularly Theo in the academies system.
[54:30.400 -> 54:34.320]  And I think it was part of the transition in the Department of Education.
[54:34.320 -> 54:37.880]  So obviously everyone knows we had a very difficult time to begin with,
[54:37.880 -> 54:39.160]  and lots of problems.
[54:39.160 -> 54:42.000]  But as things changed and senior people changed,
[54:42.000 -> 54:44.360]  and the relationships changed internally,
[54:48.560 -> 54:52.480]  then the new perms like Chris Wormald and others knew that we wanted them to work with these guys.
[54:52.480 -> 54:56.000]  But they also realized that these guys could help them.
[54:56.000 -> 54:57.440]  Now, if you've got someone like John Nash
[54:57.440 -> 55:01.920]  who's made an awful lot of money with certain skills,
[55:01.920 -> 55:05.520]  then I think Chris and other senior officials realised, well, instead
[55:05.520 -> 55:10.480]  of fighting this, which is the normal Whitehall way, why don't we do deals and why don't we
[55:10.480 -> 55:15.760]  cooperate because maybe we could all come out ahead. And also Gove's team isn't really
[55:15.760 -> 55:20.240]  giving us an option. They're telling us that we've got to do that. So, you know, there's
[55:20.240 -> 55:24.480]  carrot and stick involved, but I think probably the carrot in the end was more, to begin with,
[55:24.480 -> 55:27.080]  the stick was more important, but in the second half, I think the carrot and stick involved but I think probably the carrot in the end was more to begin with the stick was more important but in the second half I think
[55:27.080 -> 55:30.560]  the carrot and just the obvious dynamics of it and I think if you ask Chris
[55:30.560 -> 55:37.360]  Wormald you'd say annoying in various ways but also helpful in various ways
[55:37.360 -> 55:45.920]  too. Why does, why is it just,, well, why doesn't that happen more?
[55:45.920 -> 55:48.240]  Simply because of the things I described.
[55:48.240 -> 55:50.480]  The bureaucracy is programmed to resist,
[55:50.480 -> 55:51.980]  to expel outsiders.
[55:53.400 -> 55:55.400]  It doesn't want outsiders coming in,
[55:55.400 -> 55:57.120]  saying, why are you doing things like this?
[55:57.120 -> 55:59.200]  And you could do things much better doing it like that.
[55:59.200 -> 56:00.040]  It's the nature of,
[56:00.040 -> 56:01.840]  it's the fundamental nature of bureaucracies.
[56:01.840 -> 56:04.200]  So I don't think there's anything really mysterious
[56:04.200 -> 56:05.000]  about that. fundamental nature of bureaucracies. So I don't think there's anything really mysterious
[56:05.000 -> 56:07.560]  about that.
[56:07.560 -> 56:11.760]  The IFG guy, you asked me about the spending review
[56:11.760 -> 56:13.120]  and how it could be done better.
[56:16.120 -> 56:20.040]  Well, again, I think it partly goes back to incentives.
[56:20.040 -> 56:24.000]  If you think about the system now,
[56:24.000 -> 56:26.080]  so to take quite a crude example,
[56:26.080 -> 56:29.240]  Gove is in politics terms,
[56:29.240 -> 56:31.200]  a much closer friend of the Prime Minister
[56:31.200 -> 56:32.840]  than most people are in that
[56:32.840 -> 56:35.200]  Minister and Prime Minister's position.
[56:35.200 -> 56:36.840]  But the whole structure of Whitehall
[56:36.840 -> 56:39.560]  puts him in a position where he is encouraged
[56:39.560 -> 56:44.100]  to treat the spending review process as a hostile entity.
[56:44.100 -> 56:45.160]  He's encouraged not to tell Number 10 and the Treasury the truth about what as a hostile entity. He's encouraged not to tell
[56:45.160 -> 56:49.280]  number 10 and the Treasury the truth about what the real numbers are and so
[56:49.280 -> 56:53.400]  what you have is a kind of odd dance. The opaque accountancy system
[56:53.400 -> 56:57.680]  means that the Treasury knows that all the departments have got money
[56:57.680 -> 57:03.640]  squirreled down the back of the sofa and they're right they do all have money
[57:03.640 -> 57:06.720]  squirreled down the back of the sofa and it's not money squirreled down the back of the sofa and it's not only
[57:06.720 -> 57:10.160]  squirreled down the back of the sofa hidden away from the centre
[57:10.160 -> 57:13.720]  it's also hidden away from their own ministers so there's two different
[57:13.720 -> 57:14.520]  levels of
[57:14.520 -> 57:18.080]  hiding going on so the officials are not necessarily incentivised to tell the
[57:18.080 -> 57:19.440]  ministers where all the cash is
[57:19.440 -> 57:23.080]  and the ministers are not incentivised to tell the treasury where it is because if you tell the treasury where it is
[57:23.080 -> 57:23.880]  they might just say
[57:23.880 -> 57:26.360]  oh well we'll have some of it, even
[57:26.360 -> 57:39.000]  if it's stupid. So that's one big problem, but also there's no, people aren't encouraged
[57:39.000 -> 57:42.620]  to think of this as any kind of collective exercise, so there's no collective priority
[57:42.620 -> 57:48.680]  setting, and it's particularly bad with Cameron there, because there are no priorities under Cameron whatsoever, which
[57:48.680 -> 57:52.080]  makes sense. But because of that, there's no sense of what are we actually really focused
[57:52.080 -> 57:55.720]  on here? Okay, we're going to make sacrifices here in order to protect this and reinforce
[57:55.720 -> 58:01.680]  that. You know that a lot of decisions are just being made completely arbitrarily. And
[58:01.680 -> 58:06.560]  that encourages the people out in the departments to keep lying and cheating
[58:06.560 -> 58:11.000]  because why would you, if you've got this bizarre process to make decisions effectively
[58:11.000 -> 58:17.120]  randomly, why on earth would you offer to tell the truth about where money is? So the
[58:17.120 -> 58:21.600]  only way of changing that fundamentally is to change the nature of ministerial responsibility
[58:21.600 -> 58:28.320]  and to change the whole culture about how these decisions are made. As long as you keep this competitive system in which you make a bid and then the
[58:28.320 -> 58:31.520]  Treasury examines it and then comes in to find out if you're lying and you try and lie
[58:31.520 -> 58:36.480]  even more, you can't escape I don't think this process. On top of that there's also
[58:36.480 -> 58:39.480]  a skills issue, so the Treasury as I said before isn't really interested in saving
[58:39.480 -> 58:43.760]  money as far as I could ever tell, it's interested in control. A lot of people there also don't
[58:43.760 -> 58:46.040]  have the skills needed to cut budgets effectively.
[58:46.040 -> 58:47.500]  They've never worked in businesses
[58:47.500 -> 58:50.080]  where you've suddenly got to cut costs by 30% in a year.
[58:50.080 -> 58:51.200]  For a lot of the people in the treasury,
[58:51.200 -> 58:53.240]  cutting costs by 3% in a year is, oh my god,
[58:53.240 -> 58:54.400]  how are we going to do that?
[58:54.400 -> 58:56.240]  Everything will fall apart in a way which
[58:56.240 -> 58:58.160]  would seem very bizarre in the private sector.
[58:58.160 -> 59:01.880]  So I think, again, skills are just a crucial aspect of it.
[59:01.880 -> 59:04.040]  I think if you put in a team like our nets,
[59:04.040 -> 59:09.560]  like John Nash, Theo, and Paul Marshall Marshall and put them involved in spending review, then I think you'd have
[59:09.560 -> 59:19.640]  a very different kind of spending review indeed. Why does the number 10 work, my lord? The
[59:19.640 -> 59:22.760]  simple answer is to read my blog and that will explain all of the reasons why number
[59:22.760 -> 59:24.560]  10 doesn't work. It's a mix of...
[59:24.560 -> 59:38.560]  Number 10 and Cabinet Office, all of the reasons why number 10 doesn't work. It's a mix of personalities, people, skills and structure. So the nature of the Cameron
[59:38.560 -> 59:45.360]  team simply is chaos. It's all they know, it's all they've ever known. They operate in a
[59:45.360 -> 59:50.080]  bubble which is at most 10 days planning and is usually about 48 hours or 72
[59:50.080 -> 59:55.040]  hours ahead. That's it, there is no long-term priority, there is no long-term
[59:55.040 -> 59:59.800]  plan. So you have the central people operating with that kind of culture and
[59:59.800 -> 01:00:02.400]  they don't think anything can change, they just think that's politics. They're
[01:00:02.400 -> 01:00:05.020]  completely astonished if anyone says what on earth you're doing you could do
[01:00:05.020 -> 01:00:08.720]  this differently. They have no idea what you're talking about.
[01:00:08.720 -> 01:00:12.880]  The fundamental people who are the Prime Minister's advisors are Ed Llewellyn and Craig
[01:00:12.880 -> 01:00:17.360]  Oliver. Both of them are totally and utterly useless. It's not their fault, they're just in
[01:00:17.360 -> 01:00:20.260]  the wrong job. They've been put in the wrong job, it's not their fault. The fault
[01:00:20.260 -> 01:00:24.240]  lies with Cameron for having put them there. So if you have the Prime Minister who
[01:00:24.240 -> 01:00:27.720]  doesn't really, who has no sense of priorities and can't manage his way out of a paper bag
[01:00:27.720 -> 01:00:32.520]  and then there's two chief advisors of people who've never heard anything themselves, don't
[01:00:32.520 -> 01:00:36.240]  know what they're doing, Craig Oliver running around with this ridiculous grid in which
[01:00:36.240 -> 01:00:41.440]  he's worrying about Twitter and the news cycle for the next three hours, of course it's going
[01:00:41.440 -> 01:00:46.000]  to be a farce, of course you're going to see what you see all day. It can't be anything else.
[01:00:46.000 -> 01:00:50.000]  And then you have the Cabinet Office system internally, which also doesn't work
[01:00:50.000 -> 01:00:54.000]  and which doesn't connect properly to the Number 10 system.
[01:00:54.000 -> 01:00:58.000]  So you have a totally dysfunctional Number 10 system, a dysfunctional Cabinet Office system
[01:00:58.000 -> 01:01:02.000]  and the connections between them are complete chaos.
[01:01:02.000 -> 01:01:05.600]  Hence you have the Prime Minister bumbling out of EU
[01:01:05.600 -> 01:01:09.280]  press conferences, making up his own media grid on the hoof saying stop this
[01:01:09.280 -> 01:01:12.880]  announcement tomorrow morning, do this, we're not going to pay this bill, oh we
[01:01:12.880 -> 01:01:17.840]  are going to have to pay... This is the... that is how... that is normal,
[01:01:17.840 -> 01:01:21.200]  it's not abnormal and a big part of the reason why people
[01:01:21.200 -> 01:01:23.760]  can't understand what's happening in politics is they keep looking at it
[01:01:23.760 -> 01:01:27.920]  thinking this must be some aberration, somewhere there must be some quiet, calm centre,
[01:01:27.920 -> 01:01:31.320]  like in a James Bond movie where you open the door and that's where the ninjas are who
[01:01:31.320 -> 01:01:36.840]  actually know what they're doing. There are no ninjas, there is no door, what you see
[01:01:36.840 -> 01:01:43.560]  is all you get from those people. So it's partly people, it's partly skills and it's
[01:01:43.560 -> 01:01:44.560]  partly structure.
[01:01:44.560 -> 01:01:45.800]  Local government.
[01:01:45.800 -> 01:01:53.400]  Local government. Well, my argument on that would be that if a government entity is going to run something,
[01:01:53.400 -> 01:01:57.600]  then it would be better for it to be local government than central government.
[01:01:57.600 -> 01:02:02.000]  But there's a fundamental problem with that in England, which you know I'm sure a thousand times better than me,
[01:02:02.000 -> 01:02:05.520]  which is the problem of how money
[01:02:05.520 -> 01:02:09.400]  is devalued. How you have a system in which local government is nominally responsible
[01:02:09.400 -> 01:02:13.960]  for various things but it's not responsible for any of the cash and that's a fatal disaster.
[01:02:13.960 -> 01:02:18.280]  It's why so many problems happen, it's why no one really has a clue who's genuinely responsible
[01:02:18.280 -> 01:02:25.560]  for what. In a rational world you would try and solve this problem, in my world we would have massive
[01:02:25.560 -> 01:02:30.240]  central tax cuts and much more taxation pushed down locally and local government responsible
[01:02:30.240 -> 01:02:34.740]  for far more things. But there's very little appetite for that in the Conservative Party
[01:02:34.740 -> 01:02:39.720]  and I think little appetite really in the Labour Party as well. There's just a vicious
[01:02:39.720 -> 01:02:42.640]  circle in which people think to get anything done you've got to centralise it and try and
[01:02:42.640 -> 01:02:46.280]  force it through from the middle, which I think in the long run can't work, but that's what
[01:02:46.280 -> 01:02:52.440]  all parties seem to think. The reason why I don't feel guilty about what we did is because
[01:02:52.440 -> 01:02:58.040]  what we were trying to do was empower parents directly and in our ideal system in which
[01:02:58.040 -> 01:03:02.880]  you move to a national funding formula and a kind of pseudo-voucher system effectively
[01:03:02.880 -> 01:03:09.000]  in which people can control, right I'm going to go here, you get my 5k, butt your crap, I'm moving, you now get my 5k.
[01:03:09.000 -> 01:03:13.000]  Then you have a system of accountability and responsibility in the school system,
[01:03:13.000 -> 01:03:16.000]  which does not rely on politicians making intelligent judgements,
[01:03:16.000 -> 01:03:20.000]  and that's what I thought a very important goal of what we were trying to do is,
[01:03:20.000 -> 01:03:23.000]  we wanted to make the education system, the school system,
[01:03:23.000 -> 01:03:28.000]  as independent of the quality of decisions made in Whitehall
[01:03:28.000 -> 01:03:31.000]  and where they possibly could.
[01:03:31.000 -> 01:03:32.000]  We had their attentions in that.
[01:03:32.000 -> 01:03:37.000]  I was much more in that direction than Michael was,
[01:03:37.000 -> 01:03:40.000]  and we had disagreements about certain things and how to do that,
[01:03:40.000 -> 01:03:43.000]  but overall that was our approach.
[01:03:43.000 -> 01:03:46.200]  I'll take one more round of questions. I know that we've got a little one.
[01:03:46.200 -> 01:03:50.360]  So gentleman here and then a gentleman back here.
[01:03:50.360 -> 01:03:52.120]  You suggested that one of the things you'd
[01:03:52.120 -> 01:03:54.000]  say, Alistair Smith, University of Sussex,
[01:03:54.000 -> 01:03:55.960]  sorry, not an academic.
[01:03:55.960 -> 01:03:57.480]  You suggested one of the things that
[01:03:57.480 -> 01:03:59.240]  could be done with the civil service system
[01:03:59.240 -> 01:04:01.000]  is split the role of permanent secretary
[01:04:01.000 -> 01:04:04.680]  and have a chief policy officer role away
[01:04:04.680 -> 01:04:06.360]  from the chief managing officer a chief policy officer role away from the chief managing
[01:04:06.360 -> 01:04:08.280]  officer or chief executive officer.
[01:04:08.280 -> 01:04:12.880]  We've had a small experiment in that direction with the split of job between the cabinet
[01:04:12.880 -> 01:04:26.000]  secretary and the head of the civil service and it doesn't seem to have been a huge success. behind.
[01:04:26.000 -> 01:04:30.600]  Mark Foden, I work in a consultancy to do with IT reform in government.
[01:04:30.600 -> 01:04:34.760]  There's a great deal of enthusiasm from digital technologies to change the way
[01:04:34.760 -> 01:04:35.480]  government works.
[01:04:35.480 -> 01:04:37.840]  What prospect for success?
[01:04:37.840 -> 01:04:39.800]  Okay, any more, any more questions?
[01:04:39.800 -> 01:04:41.880]  Yeah, gentleman here.
[01:04:41.880 -> 01:04:44.960]  Yeah, come on, yeah.
[01:04:44.960 -> 01:04:45.000]  You might have an answer in there. Yes, gentleman here. Yes, you may have that last one, yes. Tony Farquhar. I'm just interested that you were talking about cutting down the number of people in the department, which is fine until things go wrong.
[01:04:45.000 -> 01:04:46.000]  If you haven't got people in the department, who should be doing those activities which
[01:04:46.000 -> 01:04:47.000]  they then criticise for not doing quite frequently?
[01:04:47.000 -> 01:04:48.000]  Okay, and then let's just put Christine Moore in.
[01:04:48.000 -> 01:04:49.000]  Sure.
[01:04:49.000 -> 01:04:50.000]  The lady here, yes.
[01:04:50.000 -> 01:04:51.000]  Thank you.
[01:04:51.000 -> 01:04:52.000]  Helen Dahlton.
[01:04:52.000 -> 01:04:53.000]  Yes, I'm a student of the Department of Health and Social Care.
[01:04:53.000 -> 01:04:54.000]  I'm a student of the Department of Health and Social Care.
[01:04:54.000 -> 01:04:55.000]  I'm a student of the Department of Health and Social Care.
[01:04:55.000 -> 01:04:56.000]  I'm a student of the Department of Health and Social Care.
[01:04:56.000 -> 01:04:57.000]  I'm a student of the Department of Health and Social Care.
[01:04:57.000 -> 01:04:58.000]  I'm a student of the Department of Health and Social Care.
[01:04:58.000 -> 01:04:59.000]  I'm a student of the Department of Health and Social Care.
[01:04:59.000 -> 01:05:00.000]  I'm a student of the Department of Health and Social Care.
[01:05:00.000 -> 01:05:01.000]  I'm a student of the Department of Health and Social Care.
[01:05:01.000 -> 01:05:02.000]  I'm a student of the Department of Health and Social Care.
[01:05:02.000 -> 01:05:03.000]  I'm a student of the Department of Health and Social Care.
[01:05:03.000 -> 01:05:04.000]  I'm a student of the Department of Health and Social Care.
[01:05:04.000 -> 01:05:05.800]  I'm a student of the Department of Health and Social Care. I'm a student of the Department of Health and Social Care. I'm a student of the Department of Health and Social Care. I'm a student of the Department of Health and Social Care. I'm and then let's just put Steve one more in.
[01:05:05.800 -> 01:05:06.800]  Sure.
[01:05:06.800 -> 01:05:08.000]  The lady here, yeah.
[01:05:08.000 -> 01:05:09.000]  Thank you.
[01:05:09.400 -> 01:05:12.400]  Helen Gardner, do you still want to open a free school?
[01:05:17.200 -> 01:05:19.200]  Okay, let me try and get the...
[01:05:19.200 -> 01:05:24.200]  So, the first question was about the permanent secretary, is that right?
[01:05:24.200 -> 01:05:25.000]  Yeah.
[01:05:25.000 -> 01:05:26.000]  Yeah.
[01:05:26.000 -> 01:05:31.000]  Yeah, so what I'm proposing is you say,
[01:05:31.000 -> 01:05:35.000]  here's a CEO or COO of the Department of Education
[01:05:35.000 -> 01:05:38.000]  and here's a chief policy advisor.
[01:05:38.000 -> 01:05:42.000]  It doesn't mean that the secretary has to do what this guy says at all,
[01:05:42.000 -> 01:05:46.200]  but there would be a permanent role with some
[01:05:46.200 -> 01:05:52.960]  senior people, serious people around them to give policy advice. But the COO role could
[01:05:52.960 -> 01:05:59.400]  be whoever, if Michael wanted to put John Nash in as COO, then you could just do that.
[01:05:59.400 -> 01:06:02.200]  I think there are all sorts of reasons why that would work better. I don't think your
[01:06:02.200 -> 01:06:13.160]  analogy with the experiment with Jeremy Haywood is a very good analogy for various reasons. First of all, in that, everyone
[01:06:13.160 -> 01:06:18.200]  knows that Jeremy Haywood is in charge of everything. So there's a formal division of
[01:06:18.200 -> 01:06:27.400]  responsibility supposedly, but it's all, it's not real. Jeremy Hayward is more important than anyone else in the cabinet
[01:06:27.400 -> 01:06:32.360]  apart from Cameron Osborne and arguably more important than Osborne. He sits right next
[01:06:32.360 -> 01:06:36.260]  to the Prime Minister, has him completely by the balls and Cameron doesn't do anything
[01:06:36.260 -> 01:06:41.520]  without Hayward's permission. So when they made that division, it's not, I don't think
[01:06:41.520 -> 01:06:45.960]  it's a real division because everyone knows that Heywood is really
[01:06:45.960 -> 01:06:49.980]  in charge of these. He's not just some isolated, oh he's just a policy advisor to the Prime
[01:06:49.980 -> 01:06:53.480]  Minister but he doesn't really have any institutional power anymore, that power resides with X.
[01:06:53.480 -> 01:06:57.240]  No, that power does not reside with X. X does what Heywood tells them to do. And you
[01:06:57.240 -> 01:07:07.720]  can see what's happened there with the whole COO business which they talked about. All the COOs, this new COO figure, who's his boss? Heywood. It's
[01:07:07.720 -> 01:07:13.320]  not the Prime Minister. So it's not, so the problem that you're describing kind of makes
[01:07:13.320 -> 01:07:19.840]  my point. The question about digital from a technical perspective, yes, obviously there's
[01:07:19.840 -> 01:07:23.960]  all sorts of ways in which it could happen, but I think practically you would hit a lot
[01:07:23.960 -> 01:07:29.480]  of these issues that I just talked about. Now I could be wrong about this
[01:07:29.480 -> 01:07:33.120]  because in my time there to begin with it was abysmal trying to get anything
[01:07:33.120 -> 01:07:36.680]  done like that but in the last year or so I would say some things start to
[01:07:36.680 -> 01:07:39.360]  change and in the last three months I had some very interesting conversations
[01:07:39.360 -> 01:07:42.440]  with people from the centre that suggested that some quite big things
[01:07:42.440 -> 01:07:47.160]  might change and Nick mentioned earlier when we just met
[01:07:47.160 -> 01:07:49.400]  that he's heard about some things that could change.
[01:07:49.400 -> 01:07:52.080]  So my feeling for this could be very out of date.
[01:07:52.080 -> 01:07:53.160]  Technologically, obviously, there's
[01:07:53.160 -> 01:07:54.520]  massive things that could change.
[01:07:54.520 -> 01:07:56.720]  But you'd have to deal with these connected problems
[01:07:56.720 -> 01:08:00.520]  that I discussed of procurement systems, the EU, HR,
[01:08:00.520 -> 01:08:25.320]  legal advice, and that whole mishmash of problems. If you can't do it, so sorry I haven't explained this very well, in a nutshell of course there's loads you could do but the technological problems are not the Well, it depends whether or not you actually think
[01:08:25.320 -> 01:08:27.880]  that things should be done.
[01:08:27.880 -> 01:08:29.760]  First of all, you could do,
[01:08:29.760 -> 01:08:31.600]  so take for example the free schools team.
[01:08:31.600 -> 01:08:34.120]  It's now got hundreds of people in it.
[01:08:34.120 -> 01:08:39.120]  If you actually go to reorganize that department properly
[01:08:39.480 -> 01:08:43.280]  and have proper HR system, you could do it for,
[01:08:43.280 -> 01:08:47.000]  with I reckon at the most a third of the people that are
[01:08:47.000 -> 01:08:51.120]  currently involved, and maybe something like a seventh or an eighth of the people involved.
[01:08:51.120 -> 01:08:55.100]  It doesn't need all of those people. And if you had a much smaller team that was actually
[01:08:55.100 -> 01:09:02.100]  properly managed and with a serious HR system, then also a whole load of the problems that
[01:09:02.100 -> 01:09:07.000]  currently exist wouldn't exist in the first place. So it would just be a much smoother and simpler system.
[01:09:07.000 -> 01:09:09.400]  A lot of other things, there's a prior question.
[01:09:09.400 -> 01:09:12.000]  Should the department be doing that at all?
[01:09:12.000 -> 01:09:13.600]  Sorry, that's a very big question.
[01:09:13.600 -> 01:09:14.800]  Should the NSB do it?
[01:09:14.800 -> 01:09:21.000]  Yeah, and that's a very, you know, in the end, that's a political question in various ways.
[01:09:21.000 -> 01:09:29.920]  I would, you know, I'll give you one example, it says quite a lot. When we started
[01:09:29.920 -> 01:09:33.040]  all sorts of things were completely blowing up around us, we couldn't get anything done
[01:09:33.040 -> 01:09:38.720]  on X, Y and Z that were all vital. And all I got in my first two months pretty much was
[01:09:38.720 -> 01:09:42.160]  memos on why we had to do this, that and the other on careers. Careers, careers, careers,
[01:09:42.160 -> 01:09:46.720]  you've got to create a new career service. We're going to spend hundreds of millions of pounds on careers. No end to
[01:09:46.720 -> 01:09:51.680]  careers. Endless memos on careers. We're not doing careers. This department can't even
[01:09:51.680 -> 01:09:55.960]  write its own letters accurately. There's no way on earth. The last career service was
[01:09:55.960 -> 01:09:59.440]  a complete disaster. We're having to make loads of cuts. We just shut down the last
[01:09:59.440 -> 01:10:03.200]  career service because it was such a disaster. We're not starting a new one. It's not on
[01:10:03.200 -> 01:10:06.120]  our priority list. We're not doing it.
[01:10:06.120 -> 01:10:07.160]  The memos keep coming.
[01:10:07.160 -> 01:10:09.000]  Stop sending me memos on careers.
[01:10:09.000 -> 01:10:10.000]  Memos keep going.
[01:10:10.000 -> 01:10:12.380]  And you have to walk in with a senior official to Michael
[01:10:12.380 -> 01:10:14.280]  and say, tell this guy never to write
[01:10:14.280 -> 01:10:15.480]  another memo about careers.
[01:10:15.480 -> 01:10:17.200]  And we're shutting the whole careers division down
[01:10:17.200 -> 01:10:17.740]  in this department.
[01:10:17.740 -> 01:10:20.520]  And everyone's going to start working on it, Michael says.
[01:10:20.520 -> 01:10:21.800]  That's what we're going to do.
[01:10:24.200 -> 01:10:27.640]  Months pass. Well, the careers numbers have gone down so we
[01:10:27.640 -> 01:10:32.720]  ended up by kind of crazy determination we ended up cutting the career service
[01:10:32.720 -> 01:10:35.900]  cutting cutting cutting cutting the number of people doing it but we
[01:10:35.900 -> 01:10:39.360]  could never quite kill it and every time we got close to killing it bloody
[01:10:39.360 -> 01:10:43.080]  Cameron or Clegg would come along and say oh I've got to do a speech at CBI tomorrow
[01:10:43.080 -> 01:10:46.320]  and I can't think what to do I want to to say something about careers. And then of course there's
[01:10:46.320 -> 01:10:50.240]  one where, oh yes, we've got all these lovely memos on careers. Here we are, before you
[01:10:50.240 -> 01:10:53.320]  know it the memos on careers have got the number 10 and some clown number 10 has already
[01:10:53.320 -> 01:10:58.800]  briefed it to the Telegraph and we're now creating some new careers thing. So it's very,
[01:10:58.800 -> 01:11:06.160]  very hard to stop these sort of dynamics and actually stopping things completely, which is vital
[01:11:06.160 -> 01:11:11.140]  if you're really going to change how Whitehall works, is incredibly hard. It's incredibly
[01:11:11.140 -> 01:11:15.180]  hard actually to close something down and say we're not doing it. And Michael was the
[01:11:15.180 -> 01:11:20.080]  only minister, I had a conversation about this, and I ended up pinning all the ministers
[01:11:20.080 -> 01:11:30.400]  and I said, we're stopping doing careers, Which one of you is going to go on TV and say, this department doesn't do careers anymore? Well, I don't want to. No, I don't want to
[01:11:30.400 -> 01:11:35.080]  either. I might go to the ground, but all of them said, I'll do it. He was the only
[01:11:35.080 -> 01:11:40.480]  minister in the Department of Education, or in number 10, or a Clegg, or any of them,
[01:11:40.480 -> 01:11:43.400]  who was actually prepared to go on TV and say, the Department of Education should not
[01:11:43.400 -> 01:11:46.080]  be in the business of careers. Schools should sort out careers for themselves.
[01:11:46.080 -> 01:11:48.580]  We've closed the team, saved the taxpayer this many millions
[01:11:48.580 -> 01:11:49.400]  of pounds.
[01:11:49.400 -> 01:11:51.720]  And if you don't like it, vote for someone else.
[01:11:51.720 -> 01:11:53.560]  But of course, he wasn't allowed to do that,
[01:11:53.560 -> 01:11:55.480]  because Cameron said, oh, Craig hates that.
[01:11:55.480 -> 01:11:57.280]  We've got to do some gimmicks on careers
[01:11:57.280 -> 01:11:58.720]  so he can't close it down.
[01:11:58.720 -> 01:12:00.920]  And that's just one tiny area of the department
[01:12:00.920 -> 01:12:02.880]  that I think roughly was probably
[01:12:02.880 -> 01:12:05.000]  employing a few dozen people when we started,
[01:12:05.000 -> 01:12:07.720]  maybe 30 or 40 people working on careers.
[01:12:07.720 -> 01:12:11.440]  I think, well, I was told we got it down to three people.
[01:12:11.440 -> 01:12:13.240]  That's probably a dozen again.
[01:12:13.240 -> 01:12:13.800]  I don't know.
[01:12:13.800 -> 01:12:16.400]  Someone could tell me, but don't say.
[01:12:16.400 -> 01:12:18.920]  So it's extremely hard.
[01:12:18.920 -> 01:12:21.300]  And it goes back to the point that the Secretary of State
[01:12:21.300 -> 01:12:22.840]  are not really in control.
[01:12:22.840 -> 01:12:24.240]  I mean, we only did that, we only
[01:12:24.240 -> 01:12:28.560]  got it cut at all because of the force of changing relationships inside the department. We have
[01:12:28.560 -> 01:12:33.760]  no official power to close the careers department or even to cut it by one person. We only did
[01:12:33.760 -> 01:12:39.200]  it because we said to the Permanent Secretary, we're not doing this. Stop it now. And we've
[01:12:39.200 -> 01:12:42.520]  got to make all these cuts. It's crazy to spend all this money on these things, but
[01:12:42.520 -> 01:12:45.920]  we actually need this money and these people redeployed
[01:12:45.920 -> 01:12:47.880]  elsewhere because of the spending review
[01:12:47.880 -> 01:12:50.200]  and because of all sorts of other pressures on us.
[01:12:53.520 -> 01:12:54.520]  Last question.
[01:12:54.520 -> 01:12:55.200]  Free school.
[01:12:55.200 -> 01:12:57.880]  No, I've decided I'm not a good person to set up a free school.
[01:12:57.880 -> 01:13:00.040]  As Clint Eastwood said, man's got a nose limitations.
[01:13:00.040 -> 01:13:08.000]  And I think I would be a bad person to set up a school. I've helped a few schools get going,
[01:13:08.000 -> 01:13:13.000]  and I think that's probably where my help is best used.
[01:13:13.000 -> 01:13:17.000]  I'm very happy to answer more questions if people have got them.
[01:13:17.000 -> 01:13:19.000]  OK, let's take one more.
[01:13:19.000 -> 01:13:27.000]  Could I just ask a subsequent question? This complexity thing interests me. What response do you get talking to senior folks around
[01:13:27.000 -> 01:13:31.000]  the Whitehall about complexity and the problems that it's causing? Do people understand it
[01:13:31.000 -> 01:13:36.000]  on an intellectual level or do they resist it or what?
[01:13:36.000 -> 01:13:43.000]  I'd say by far the most interesting responses I've had have been from Fields medalists and
[01:13:43.000 -> 01:13:48.300]  Nobel Prize winners and what not sending me random emails saying, very interesting about blah blah blah, what do
[01:13:48.300 -> 01:13:52.520]  you think about this, why does politics not understand, and so I think in the
[01:13:52.520 -> 01:13:56.560]  science and maths world, for them this sort of stuff is completely second
[01:13:56.560 -> 01:13:59.740]  nature intellectually. I mean it's their world, they created it, so it's not
[01:13:59.740 -> 01:14:04.300]  surprising. But in Whitehall, it's like an alien language pretty much, no one
[01:14:04.300 -> 01:14:05.400]  really is if
[01:14:05.400 -> 01:14:08.360]  you've gone through even if you're a very high-performing person like say
[01:14:08.360 -> 01:14:12.280]  Cameron in a traditional sense you've gone through Eton you've gone to a good
[01:14:12.280 -> 01:14:16.360]  school you've then gone on done some kind of humanities course or PPE that
[01:14:16.360 -> 01:14:20.160]  doesn't expose you really to any of this thinking so unless you're an
[01:14:20.160 -> 01:14:24.440]  intellectually curious person which Cameron spectacularly is not then
[01:14:24.440 -> 01:14:28.160]  there's no reason why you'll be exposed to this sort of thing.
[01:14:28.160 -> 01:14:30.960]  Then there's one guy, I've noticed a guy called Andrew Haldane at the Bank of
[01:14:30.960 -> 01:14:33.440]  England, who talks about this sort of thing and
[01:14:33.440 -> 01:14:39.760]  gives some extremely interesting lectures. I slightly worry
[01:14:39.760 -> 01:14:43.200]  about him and I wonder if anyone in Whitehall takes what he says
[01:14:43.200 -> 01:14:47.200]  seriously. I hope they do, but he's almost the only senior person ac rwy'n meddwl os ydyn nhw'n cydweithio gyda'r cyhoedd yn y byd, mae'n cydweithio'n ddiolchgar. Rwy'n gobeithio y byddwn yn ei wneud, ond mae'n unig unig person penodol
[01:14:47.200 -> 01:14:48.400]  rydw i wedi gweld
[01:14:48.400 -> 01:14:50.800]  sy'n cymryd rhan
[01:14:50.800 -> 01:14:52.600]  â'r agenda ddysgol hwnnw
[01:14:52.600 -> 01:14:55.800]  ac sy'n siarad amdano yn ffyrdd cyhoeddus.
[01:14:55.800 -> 01:14:56.600]  Rwy'n credu bod hynny'n dda iawn
[01:14:56.600 -> 01:14:58.000]  fod yn y Bank yng Nghymru
[01:14:58.000 -> 01:15:00.000]  ac rwy'n gobeithio y bydd pobl penodol yno
[01:15:00.000 -> 01:15:00.800]  yn mynd i'w gwrando,
[01:15:00.800 -> 01:15:02.200]  ond bydd rhywun eraill yma
[01:15:02.200 -> 01:15:03.400]  yn gwybod yn well nad oes gennyf
[01:15:03.400 -> 01:15:07.000]  a oes ganddo unrnd i'w ddysgu ond bydd rhywun eraill yn gwybod mwy o bethau na fi ynglyn â phobl sydd ganddyn nhw.
[01:15:07.000 -> 01:15:17.000]  Yw unrhyw un yn ymddangos hynny? Mae'n golygu eich bod chi'n ceisio ddatgani'r ffaith bod y peth hwn yn ymwneud â'r ffordd gwahanol o ddathlu ati.
[01:15:17.000 -> 01:15:28.320]  Yn fy mhrofiad, wrth ddweud wrth rywun amdano, yw'n ddiddorol, y byddent yn deall. that intellectually at least they will understand it. I can't help thinking if some effort is put into explaining this stuff to folks,
[01:15:28.320 -> 01:15:32.680]  there might be a bit of progress, but it's not going to be fixed in an afternoon.
[01:15:32.680 -> 01:15:37.840]  No, there's a few things that I'm thinking about.
[01:15:37.840 -> 01:15:46.200]  I'm going to try and talk to some universities about creating new courses.
[01:15:46.200 -> 01:15:50.400]  As I said in my talk, we need alternatives to PPE, and one of the obvious things that
[01:15:50.400 -> 01:15:57.520]  will be part of that would be teaching the basics of that subject. I'm also talking to
[01:15:57.520 -> 01:16:06.940]  some physicists who are interested in running some training courses in Westminster for MPs to try and teach them some of these things in basic probability
[01:16:06.940 -> 01:16:12.580]  and how the tools used in physics in particular
[01:16:12.580 -> 01:16:15.900]  can be applied to all kinds of complex problems.
[01:16:15.900 -> 01:16:19.100]  If you look, one of the projects I'm most proud of,
[01:16:19.100 -> 01:16:22.820]  actually, that we did in 2012, I went
[01:16:22.820 -> 01:16:25.360]  to see a guy called Tim Gowers at Cambridge University
[01:16:25.360 -> 01:16:30.200]  who's a field's medalist, one of the cleverest people in the world. I was talking to him about various things
[01:16:30.200 -> 01:16:34.360]  and he said what I want to do is create a course, a 16 to 18 maths course
[01:16:34.360 -> 01:16:37.960]  for maths for presidents type
[01:16:37.960 -> 01:16:41.920]  type course and I thought that's a brilliant idea
[01:16:41.920 -> 01:16:49.000]  and talked to Michael about it, we ended up buying, I think, about half a million quid to MEI to work with Gowers to develop that course.
[01:16:49.000 -> 01:16:53.500]  And it's now real. There are modules of the course, there's teacher training going on.
[01:16:53.500 -> 01:16:57.500]  It's going to start in schools in September 2015. Well, it's been trialled now.
[01:16:57.500 -> 01:17:02.500]  But although that's a 16 to 18 maths course, which I hope will have a big effect on schools,
[01:17:02.500 -> 01:17:04.500]  if you go and read his blog, if you Google his blog,
[01:17:04.500 -> 01:17:06.180]  a lot of the problems in it are things
[01:17:06.180 -> 01:17:08.680]  that you could use in a training course for MPs.
[01:17:08.680 -> 01:17:12.040]  So I think there'll be a lot of good.
[01:17:12.040 -> 01:17:13.600]  The most popular course on Berkeley
[01:17:13.600 -> 01:17:16.600]  is often voted the Physics for Presidents course.
[01:17:16.600 -> 01:17:18.100]  There's a brilliant book on it, which
[01:17:18.100 -> 01:17:21.080]  I would advise anyone to buy.
[01:17:21.080 -> 01:17:23.440]  And I think there's a huge scope, potentially,
[01:17:23.440 -> 01:17:25.600]  for developing courses like that.
[01:17:25.600 -> 01:17:29.240]  No, no one has to be able to go and do advanced calculus. That's not the sort of thing that
[01:17:29.240 -> 01:17:34.840]  I'm talking about. But having basic conceptual understanding of these things and understanding
[01:17:34.840 -> 01:17:40.080]  when science, when maths and physics in particular might be able to help you and when they can't,
[01:17:40.080 -> 01:17:45.840]  when you're on your own, even just knowing that would be a great advance. But when you're on your own, even just knowing that would be a great advance.
[01:17:45.840 -> 01:17:50.560]  But when you have people now who've got no concept of what randomness means or what probability
[01:17:50.560 -> 01:17:55.040]  is, who can't, as that statistical survey showed, just do the most basic questions,
[01:17:55.040 -> 01:17:58.900]  and they're voting and deciding on crucial questions of risk involving billions or tens
[01:17:58.900 -> 01:18:02.880]  of billions of pounds, you're obviously going to have a lot of things go wrong.
[01:18:02.880 -> 01:18:06.600]  So the risk-reward of trying to get some things
[01:18:06.600 -> 01:18:08.840]  like the Gowers course into MPs' brains,
[01:18:08.840 -> 01:18:11.220]  I think is massive.
[01:18:12.400 -> 01:18:14.600]  Great, okay, well Dominic, thank you very much indeed.
[01:18:14.600 -> 01:18:16.240]  I mean, that was really, really stimulating.
[01:18:16.240 -> 01:18:17.800]  And I first came across Dominic's work
[01:18:17.800 -> 01:18:20.160]  when reading his essay when published first,
[01:18:20.160 -> 01:18:21.680]  I think, via the Guardian.
[01:18:21.680 -> 01:18:22.920]  And if you haven't read it, you know,
[01:18:22.920 -> 01:18:24.600]  I mean, I'd try anybody with a modicum
[01:18:24.600 -> 01:18:25.400]  of intellectual curiosity not to find it really interesting. And if you haven't read it, I'd try anybody with a modicum of intellectual curiosity
[01:18:25.480 -> 01:18:27.000]  not to find it really interesting.
[01:18:27.080 -> 01:18:29.000]  I do encourage you to read it.
[01:18:29.080 -> 01:18:31.560]  And Dominic, I would encourage you to set up an Odyssean Free School.
[01:18:31.640 -> 01:18:33.360]  I think you'd have a lot of takers for it.
[01:18:33.440 -> 01:18:34.440]  It would be very interesting.
[01:18:34.520 -> 01:18:36.080]  And I hope you can come back and talk to us again
[01:18:36.160 -> 01:18:38.600]  about this central national mission you talked about,
[01:18:38.680 -> 01:18:40.600]  about making Britain the world leader in education and science,
[01:18:40.680 -> 01:18:43.840]  because I think that's a very interesting and important idea
[01:18:43.920 -> 01:18:44.960]  and we should explore it further.
[01:18:49.000 -> 01:18:55.680]  Can I ask you to thank Dominic in the usual way.
[01:19:25.000 -> 01:19:30.000]  Thank you. . .
