Welcome to The Inquiry with me, Tanya Beckett.
 __One__  question,  __four__  expert witnesses and an answer.
The world is in the middle of an energy crisis.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led to an energy price shock,
the likes of which has not been seen since the 1970s.
Many countries have rushed to produce more coal and oil to bring down prices.
And this has contributed to existing worries about damage to the environment and climate change.
But there's also been a renewed focus on how countries can generate more power
from sustainable sources and rely less on fossil fuels than the international market.
So this week on The Inquiry, we're asking,
can a country live on renewable energy alone?
Part  __One__  What is Renewable Energy?
Renewable energy is  __one__  that has an everlasting source.
And specifically in our case, the sun provides us a never-ending supply of energy.
And so when the sun's energy reaches the earth, it can directly convert to electricity or to heat,
and it can also warm the earth, which drives the wind.
So renewable energy is energy that is ever replenished and is sustainable.
Our first witness is a world-renowned expert in solar cells and is also working out how to convert
the most populous US state to renewable energy without the risk of blackouts.
I'm Sarah Kurtz. I'm a professor at the University of California, Merced.
Solar and wind energy make up a  __ten__ th of all of the electricity generated around the world.
But we currently get most of our renewable energy globally from hydropower,
or the generation of electricity through the flow of water.
We've been generating electricity from windmills, watermills and solar panels
for nearly a century and a  __half__ .
What's changed in recent years is that the technology has become more efficient and cheaper.
The cost per square meter of a panel is about the same as if you hired somebody to come in
and paint your house. So it's really amazing how much the costs have come down,
the efficiencies have gone up, the rate of change of the evolution of the technology is
actually accelerating.
Scientific progress has led to solar and wind power growing in capacity
and making up an increasingly large part of the energy mix.
But we still face limitations.
When the sun sets, we need to figure out how to use the sun's energy to keep the lights on
during the night. And so we need to have a system that can be automated to identify when we're going
to have renewable electricity and when we need to use storage to be able to provide electricity
in the gaps.
Storage comes of course in the form of batteries.
Now this is  __one__  thing when we're talking about powering cars or heating,
but we've seen that high power prices have left many manufacturers finding it hard to keep going.
And this needs to be factored into our thinking.
But only once a significant proportion of our electricity comes from renewable sources.
We don't need to have storage until we get up into the range of something like  __15__  to  __25__ %.
Our ability to deliver the large scale storage is not yet adequate,
but it is I think currently  __one__  of the main bottlenecks.
Although we could do much more with solar and wind than what we're doing now without storage.
Battery capacity isn't our only challenge when it comes to renewable electricity.
Solar panels, hydro plants and wind turbines need to be situated in locations that allow them to
work best. Fossil fuels by contrast can be burned to produce energy close to where it's needed.
With a car that you fill it with gasoline, you can fill it at a rate that is really remarkable in
terms of the rate of the energy transfer. But if you look at putting out a solar panel, the rate
at which it collects the sunshine is much slower. Also, if we want to rely more on renewable energy,
we need to build more capacity to produce it. Production capacity is currently forecast to
increase by over  __60__ % between  __2020__  and  __2026__  globally. But when we're working out how much
electricity we need, we have to bear in mind that as the global population grows, so does demand
for energy. Getting the infrastructure developed can take some time. It took us decades to develop
our current grid that has put wires all across both cities and countryside. And to be able to
develop renewable energy to the same level, we should expect will take decades to put in
that infrastructure. And so it's just a challenge of how quickly we can move.
Building renewable electricity generation is cheaper than coal and gas plants, but the money
still needs to be made available to make it happen. The technology is there to do it, but investing
in that infrastructure is difficult, both for permitting and policy reasons. And also it can be
difficult to identify who will pay for an expansion like that when it's something that the whole
community uses. There is a country though whose government made a very large call on all of this
a long time ago and whose electricity is almost all from renewable sources. That country is Iceland.
Part  __two__ , fire and ice.
If you invest in the right infrastructure, a renewable  __one__ ,  __one__  that supports a green future,
the benefits is something that people do not reap the day after or in the years after.
The infrastructure can support generations for decades. Iceland is often referred to as the land
of fire and ice, an island of just a  __third__  of a  __million__  people that can be circumnavigated in less
than a day. This small Nordic nation is home to some of the world's most unique geology.
As its name suggests, a  __ten__ th of Iceland is covered in glaciers, but it's also home to scores of
volcanic mountains. This is because the country sits on the border of  __two__  tectonic plates or a
split in the earth's crust, so heat can make its way up to the surface from closer to the earth's
core. The result is not just a mass of volcanoes, but also  __hundred__ s of hot springs.
My name is Halle Rundl├│├░ur. I'm the Director General of Iceland's National Energy Authority
and I come from Iceland. Halle explains how in  __1908__ , over a century ago, Icelanders began to
harvest the heat from hot springs to warm their homes. There was a farmer that found a way to
connect his house to a neighboring hot spring, then few others did the same, and from there
municipalities scaled the effort. The first drilling was done in Reykjavik in  __1928__  and then
it scaled from only a few buildings like our hospital and  __one__  of our main schools being heated
with geothermal into a national policy that really helped us make the transition that we have today.
An energy solution that had begun with  __one__  individual over a  __hundred__  years ago was given
financial impetus in the 1960s from the capital, Reykjavik. A brilliant thing that the government
did around that time was that it established what we call the Iceland Energy Fund. It was a fund that
gave municipalities money to drill for geothermal and if a drilling was successful, the funding
turned into a long-term loan but if it was unsuccessful, a part of the cost was cancelled.
So it helped the municipalities to take the risk knowing that the full cost of the drilling would
not end up on their shoulders if the drilling was not successful. Today,  __nine__  out of  __ten__  houses in
Iceland are heated with geothermal energy. You can imagine here in Iceland, even though it's
not always stormy, we often live up to our name having ice cold winters with unpredictable weather
but thanks to geothermal, the hot water flows through pipes into our houses and we heat the
houses with the geothermal energy which keeps our life standards and living conditions extremely
good despite those cold winter days. So geothermal is a big part of Iceland's quality of life, if you
will. The energy stored in Iceland's hot springs can also be used in other ways to power other parts
of the economy. The exciting part of geothermal is that you can also use it for electricity
production. Food production has a lot of potential when it comes to geothermal because you can use
it in greenhouses and thanks to geothermal and our renewables in general, we are able to
produce a lot of our vegetables locally all year around. Almost all of Iceland's electricity comes
from geothermal sources but when it comes to fuel for transport, Halle says the country still has
some way to go to break free from fossil fuels. Actually over  __50__  percent of newly registered cars
are purely electric and in the case of the fishing fleet, the government has been investing in
retrofitting ships and in aviation our main carrier has been focusing on electrifying our
internal flights completely within the next decade. Aside from paying substantially less for energy,
Iceland also benefits from cleaner air than many of its European neighbours. If you look at pictures
from the early 1900s from Reykjavik, you can see this thick black cloud looming over the city
and then if you look at pictures from the same angle after the geothermal district heating
systems were built, you can see clear blue skies. So the impact on air quality has been enormous
so it was actually already in  __1938__  something that was on the front page of  __one__  of our largest
newspaper vote for geothermal it said vote for the clean air. Iceland is blessed with rather unique
geology that helped propel it along the path to green energy but with the right approach
could other countries follow Iceland's example? Part  __three__  the energy mix
our  __third__  expert witness is  __one__  of the authors of a major report on renewable energy published in
 __2018__  stating that in  __20__  years the world could generate all of its energy from renewable sources
 __two__ - __third__ s of which would come from solar panels. My name is Christian Breyer, I'm professor for
solar economy at Lod University in Finland. Christian emphasizes that Iceland is unusually
blessed when it comes to generating renewable energy but the rest of the world still has much
to learn from its extraordinary journey. Iceland is a great example of what can be achieved with
renewable energy however it has very special conditions because it's a rather large island
with a rather small population. The success with renewable energy is to make the best of the existing
local resources which in most regions in the world will be always solar energy and in quite
many other regions in the world it's wind energy and in many parts in the world it's still hydropower
and if geothermal energy is available it's great. And in order to be successful in breaking away
from fossil fuels we just need to get the mix of green energy exactly right. In the summer in the
northern hemisphere solar energy is really good during daytime the wind energy is excellent in
the winter  __half__  year very often  __24__ / __7__  and then we have to combine both resources and then of course
with the renewable energy we need flexibility in the system flexibility in demand and storage.
Christian cites the example of India the world's  __third__  largest emitter of greenhouse gases
but where the supply of renewable energy is growing faster than in any other major economy.
This is helped by powerful sunshine for much of the year but India is also subjected to prolonged
periods of rain. So there might be a kind of a partial shortage of solar energy in some parts
of India during the monsoon but only  __half__  of the country is affected so the other  __half__  would still
have the full sunshine then with better grid capacities  __one__  could send more solar electricity
from the not monsoon affected regions to the other regions during that time. Aside from transferring
electricity from  __one__  location to another as we heard earlier an alternative solution is to have
enough battery capacity to store it locally when the sun isn't shining. Christian says as well as
investing in more batteries India can also use the existing batteries it has in the nation's growing
number of electric cars.  __80__  percent of all batteries we need as a society we will need in vehicles
typically rolling on the road so for cars for trucks for buses so there we will need most of
the batteries and they're very valuable because they can indirectly balance the electricity
generation we call that smart charging smart ev charging. Users can also be incentivized to consume
or store energy when it's plentiful and not when it's in short supply but in many cases even without
storage renewable energy can prove transformational particularly in cases where it may be the only
source of power available.  __One__  example of this is Yemen a country on the southern end of the
Arabian Peninsula whose power grid has been damaged by years of conflict and has  __one__  of the highest
poverty rates in the world. Here solar panels have helped many schools hospitals and homes to keep
going. They have a solar system they have a battery and with that they get a minimum electricity
supply for all their needs and they had only to once manage to get this system and now it runs for
years so this is just an example that even in a very unstable environment renewables might be
still the best stable solution. If a country in which  __million__ s of people struggle to feed themselves
has been able to benefit from renewable energy how might green power change not just the environment
but the whole of geopolitics?
Part  __four__  green giants. Australia produces a  __third__  of its electricity from renewable sources
it's a country tailor-made for clean energy with more sunshine than any other continent and a long
coastline ideal for offshore wind farms. So from where our  __four__ th expert witness joins us
the outlook for renewable energy looks decidedly optimistic. Tim Buckley director climate energy
finance in Sydney. Tim predicts that although the cost of energy has recently soared the rise in
renewable energy means that in the long term it will plummet. We've never seen this sort of level
of price inflation and so there is a clear economic and political imperative to decarbonize to invest.
I'm predicting the electricity price the wholesale price of electricity is going to drop by
upwards of  __50__   __60__   __70__  percent over the coming decade. Part of the reason for Tim's optimism
on energy prices is something we heard about in part  __three__ . As more Australians buy electric cars
their batteries will be able to store any renewable electricity that they don't use immediately.
When you're looking at  __20__   __million__  batteries on wheels that will play a huge function in terms
of absorbing excess generation every day when it's sunny in Australia the price of electricity will
probably be negative and so you'll be able to charge your car free if it's plugged in but then
obviously predictably the sun goes down at  __six__  o'clock at night demand goes up as everyone goes
home and I think those electric vehicles are going to play a key role there. So it is the
convergence of transport power and industry that makes this a rather complex and messy transition.
If this is the future for Australia then many other nations surely will find themselves on a
similar path producing a mix of solar wind and hydro power on their own soil. So this brings us
to another question. Energy has played a role in many international conflicts including the war in
Ukraine. Sometimes it's part of the reason for the conflict and sometimes it's weaponized and is
therefore a consequence. I asked Tim if nations produce more of their own power then could this
lead to a profound change in geopolitics? Almost every country in the last  __hundred__  years has been
ruled by energy security pressures. Obviously the wider European market is getting a very rude
wake-up call as to the risks of energy security reliance on other countries benevolence in supplying
your core infrastructure and so you are going to see a massive shift in the geopolitics and the
flows of energy and the types of energy that are used. How will this pan out then between countries?
Will there be energy superpowers or will more countries simply be self-sufficient? We are going
to see a massive global realignment and  __one__  of the wonderful things about renewable energy is
it encourages countries to be self-sufficient so long as they have strong solar radiation and good
wind resources. So we are actually going to see improved energy security for a number of countries,
Australia being  __one__  of the major beneficiaries but countries like China and India, America will
all increase their self-sufficiency of energy so it's going to improve the geopolitical issues
relating to global energy trade for some countries. So what regions of the world do you think will
struggle to make the transition to renewable energy? Japan and Korea have been in diffused
positions for decades. They are very large, heavily industrialised economies, very dependent
on imported fossil fuels but neither country has very good solar radiation. They don't have a lot
of land onshore for wind and they have got high population density so it does mean that they are
challenged so they'll be some of the harder to decarbonise economies and they are going to be
constrained by their continued use of fossil fuels. So now we return to our question,
can a country live on renewable energy alone? The short answer is yes it can. Some smaller nations
now get nearly all of their energy from renewable power, Costa Rica, New Zealand, Norway and Iceland
being  __four__  of them. And there are several large countries, China, Australia and India making
huge strides. The question of transporting electricity from  __one__  country to another
via so-called interconnectors is in many cases a task fraught with difficulties.
But there have been some successes. In  __2021__  the largest undersea cable in the world began
transporting renewable electricity between Norway and Britain. It allows excess renewable power to
flow from  __one__  country to another depending on which nation has produced more than it needs.
Countries though which are geographically or politically isolated and don't have good
conditions for producing renewable energy are likely to find international collaboration a
struggle. But the largest stumbling block is unquestionably the building of renewable energy
capacity. A final word from our second expert witness. And if we don't use the energy crisis
in Europe now to invest in the right infrastructure that supports the green transition, we have lost
an opportunity and we will be living with an infrastructure that does not support the climate
goals not for the next few years but for the decades to come. This episode of The Inquiry
