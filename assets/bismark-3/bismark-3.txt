C (jTJJfcL ^ ^tJNE r6, 1871, the German Kaiser, preceded by Bismarck, Roon,
/"1^¾¾¾ and Moltke, entered the city of Berlin on horseback in triumph at
U V T C V ) the head of forty thousand troops newly returned from France.
^<z—-/ George Bancroft, the American minister, described the scene.
"The via triumphalis was about three miles long, through streets as wide and
in some places thrice as wide as Broadway." Cannon captured from the French
were parked in close order on both sides of the route, which was also lined by
"flag-staffs garlanded and festooned with oak-leaves and evergreens." At intervals stood three huge statues made of linen covered with gypsum and
stuffed with straw: at the start a "gigantic image, representing the city of Berlin"; at midpoint "a colossal victory, having on her right hand and left statues
of Strassburg and Metz"; at the end "a Germania receiving back into her arms
Alsace and Lorraine." More than one million people crowded the sidewalks
under a brilliant sun and, when night came, every house and building in Berlin was illuminated. At the opera a glittering company of royalty, nobility,
and generals viewed two pageants specially composed for the occasion. "The
first represented Justice as having done its work in the late war, and now
introducing Peace attended by all the Seasons and all the Arts. The second
showed Barbarossa spellbound in his cave, dreaming on till the empire should
be restored, and seeing in his visions what the spectators saw in tableaux vivants, the epoch-making incidents of German history, from the crusades and
early humble fortunes of the younger branch of the Hohenzollerns, to the
moment when its chief was upborne at Versailles as emperor by the arms of
the princes of Germany." Germany, Bancroft concluded, enjoyed a "feeling
of security such as it never had before."1
While Germany reveled in the euphoria of triumph, the rest of Europe
shuddered. Three stunning victories within six years had elevated Prussia,
whose qualifications for great power status had been questioned before 1866,
to a leading position among European nations. Two great powers had been
humbled by the superior discipline of its soldiers, the competence of its generals, and brilliance of its political leadership. Geographical size and position,
rapidly growing industrial and financial strength, larger population, and the
size and capacity of its army made the new German Reich the most formidable

power on the continent. Bismarck, whose chance of survival had been widely
discounted in 1862, was now the dominant figure in German and European
politics. Naturally questions arose. What new goals would the "man of blood
and iron" now pursue? What new conquests might be necessary to satiate a
people steeped in the history and legends of medieval empire? What Germanic people or German-speaking minority would be the next target of the
German quest for national unity?
Contrary to these expectations, German unification did not introduce a
new era of conquest and bloodshed in Europe. Instead, it was the prelude to
a period of international order that lasted, despite many crises, more than
forty years. After 1871 Bismarck, whose direction of German foreign policy
went almost unchallenged for nearly half that time, became an arbiter of
peace rather than war. In his view Germany was externally a satiated state
whose interests in foreign policy were now best served by the preservation
of the European balance of power as reconstructed in the wars of Italian
and German unification. From 1871 to 1890 his foreign policy was the defensive shield behind which the German nation coped with the problems of
internal unification. No word and no task was more often in Bismarck's
expressed thoughts during these decades than that of "consolidation" (Konsolidierung). During the 1880s as the problems—and failures—mounted, the
word changed, significantly, to "fortification" (Befestigung).
The problems of national unity were regional, cultural, and social in character. In 1871 it was by no means certain that the states and dynasties of the
German Reich, after decades and centuries of independence, would fully accept their new status as member states of a federal union. This was true even
of Prussia, whose ministers and officials were inclined to view the emerging
imperial government either as an enemy of Prussian interests or as an extension of Prussian power and authority. In all of the great wars fought on the
European continent since the Reformation one or more German states had
collaborated with outside powers against their German neighbors. Bismarck
could not assume that the conception of self-interest that dictated such combinations would now disappear. The exclusion of Austria from Germany, furthermore, had upset the equilibrium between the Catholic and Protestant
churches and populations. Catholics now found themselves a minority in a
largely Protestant country headed by a Protestant dynasty. Political unity under these terms raised again the old question of Germany's religious division.
These issues were closely linked to the additional problem of Germany's
ethnic minorities. The German Reich of 1871 had a population in excess of
41 million, of whom well over 3 million were non-Germans, judged on the
basis of language. Of these minorities by far the largest was Prussia's Poles,
followed by Danes, Frenchmen, Lithuanians, Wends, and Czechs. In addition, more than one million German-speaking Alsatians thought of themselves as Frenchmen. All of these minorities except the Danes were of Cath-

olic faith, and in the Polish case Catholicism and national identity were
closely linked. Their involuntary incorporation into the "German nation"
inevitably increased the sense of divergent national identity among the subject peoples. Here too the danger existed that a combination of foreign and
domestic foes might endanger the frontiers and unity of the German Reich.
These problems of lateral (that is, regional and ethnic) unity were accompanied and soon overshadowed by problems of vertical (that is, social) cohesion. Germany's national unification occurred in a period of unparalleled economic growth marked by both industrial and agrarian expansion. The
internal consolidation of the German Reich, begun in prosperity (18711873), had to continue during a severe depression (1873-1879), an economic
earthquake whose aftershocks continued to the end of Bismarck's chancellorship. The critical social and political question of the era of industrialization
was whether the old Prussian establishment (crown, cabinet, bureaucracy,
Protestant church, officer corps, and gentry) would both accept and integrate
into the traditional order the new elites produced by commercial and industrial expansion and by the rapid growth of finance capitalism. In view of the
Russian experience in the same era, another significant issue was whether the
traditional order would be able to appease and integrate the new intelligentsia
(the academically trained elite of scholars, journalists, lawyers, jurists, and
civil servants) whose dissidence had found expression since the 1830s in philosophical radicalism, liberal politics, and socialist agitation. Would the new
elites of BMung und Besitzfinda place within the old order or would they turn
against it, as had seemed possible during the revolution of 1848 and the constitutional conflict of 1862-1866?
This book is the middle volume of a trilogy, all three of which deal primarily with the role of Otto von Bismarck in the development of these related
problems.2 In the previous volume it was shown how in successive stages the
Prussian establishment, both consciously and unconsciously, faced the task of
their resolution. In this volume and its sequel we shall see that the final burst
of economic expansion that paralleled, and the depression that followed,
Germany's political unification raised to an acute level the problem of social
consolidation, that is, the task of integrating the steadily growing stratum of
factory and mine workers into a national consensus. Could an expanded Prussian-German establishment prevent or overcome the alienation of urban labor and thereby limit the growth of a socialist doctrine that attacked its institutions, system of property rights, and class privileges? Of the many tasks of
national consolidation that the Bismarck government undertook, this proved
to be the most critical.

The author's acknowledgments and an account of the genesis of the entire work are to be
found in the prefaces to volume one. The introduction to the same volume contains a statement
of the "Bismarck problem" as it has developed since 1945 and a "discourse on method" that are
relevant to all three volumes.

* Introduction to Volumes II & III +

We shall see that the deep current in what Bismarck called the "stream of
time"—that is, economic development, demographic redistribution, and financial concentration—provided the most effective means of consolidation
during his chancellorship. Another deep current that contributed to it was
the growth of German national sentiment. After centuries of internal division
and external weakness the Germans had achieved a new status in Europe and
in the world. Military might, material progress, and cultural and scientific
achievement gave to most Germans a sense of national pride that tended to
dissolve particularistic sentiments and interests (except among ethnic minorities, where the opposite occurred). These material and moral deep currents
(the term "deep structure" popularized by the Annates school is too static) had
an immanent force that tended to solidify the German union independently
of governmental action. The crucial question of the Second Reich was
whether Bismarck's policies and actions would contribute to that stabilization
on the upper levels of the stream, where conflicting currents and eddies provided some latitude for intervention and control. Would his vision and skill
suffice to provide the sluices and channels that would direct the flow? Could
the most powerful statesman of the age reconcile or overcome the divisions
between the German majority and ethnic minorities, between Catholics and
Protestants, between the old agrarian and new industrial elites, and between
those elites and urban labor? Could the unifier of the German states unite the
German people?
These are the chief problems and themes with which the trilogy is concerned. They have determined in large part its shape and the distribution of
historical material it contains. Readers will note that the proportionate space
allocated to foreign policy in the last two volumes is considerably less than in
the first. This distribution was determined by the themes of consolidation and
fortification. Until 1871 Bismarck's foreign policy had a creative, thereafter a
protective role in German development. The acts of unification created the
crucible within which the process of internal integration could proceed.
Thereafter the task of Bismarck's foreign policy was to shelter that process
against outside intervention. This is not to diminish Bismarck's continuing
impact on international politics but merely to assert that the most enduring
consequences of his statesmanship for German development after 1871 were
in the field of domestic affairs.
Bismarck's skepticism concerning the capacity of statesmen to control,
much less determine the destiny of peoples, was not entirely justified. The
tenacity with which he clung to power to the end shows that he too was aware
that it mattered whose hand was on the switches and valves in Berlin. From
this it follows that his personality and character are important for an understanding of German history in this period. Important also was the ebb and
flow of Bismarck's mental and physical health, to which increasing attention
is given in these two volumes. We shall see that there was a close relationship

at times between his political behavior and the state of his mind and body.

The Reich of Iron
and Blood

Recent historical developments in Germany press toward the
centralization of forces and political arrangements, and their natural
and unavoidable consequence must be the gradual absorption [by the
Reich] of its member states. In my opinion all that can be done is to
impede and delay this development until the public has turned away
from the pursuit of special, particularistic interests toward the complete union of Germany into a single state. Back of the unceasing
pressure of the unifying political parties is a driving element that converts ideal goals into practical necessities. It is the powerful development of material interests, of industrial activity, of commerce and
trade. To slow the progress of things in some degree and make
the transition less painful for those whom it affects
requires a constant, exhausting struggle.

at Berlin, in 1873

Consolidation and Cleavage

X3^L(^RUSSIA must do for the whole of Germany what it has done for
/ " ^ ) I J itself. Once it made the conquered forget the conquest in the
γ * « ^ S\ regions won from Poland, France, and Saxony, elevating the inhab^ < J 9 - ^ itants of these regions to a feeling of unity and equality [with the
rest of Prussia]. Now it must erase the distinction between victor and van­
quished, which no people can tolerate indefinitely, replacing the conscious­
ness of belonging to separate states and peoples [Stdmme] with a proud and
happy loyalty to a German commonwealth headed by the King of Prussia."1
By these means Bismarck expected in 1867 to solve the formidable problem
of integrating and consolidating united Germany. The population of the
North German Confederation, later of the German Reich, was to be welded
together primarily through the activity of government and by the dynastic
loyalty that such activity, reinforced by time and shared experience, would
create. In this way the Hohenzollern had succeeded over two centuries
(1640-1840) in building a sense of statehood and Prussianism among the dis­
parate peoples of East Prussia, Pomerania, Brandenburg, Silesia, Westphalia,
and the Rhineland. To the end of his life Bismarck clung to the belief that
dynastic loyalty was the backbone of German nationalism.2
Certainly the imperial tradition, the "nationalization" of Prussian-Hohenzollern history, and the personal charisma of Bismarck and Wilhelm I expe­
dited the psychological integration of the German Reich. Their role in forg­
ing a sense of German nationhood was probably as important—and as
unmeasurable—as the achievements in German cultural life in the age of
Goethe, Schiller, Kant, and Hegel. Yet there were other, material forces that
contributed to that end—forces of which Bismarck was aware, but to which
he paid little attention in his memoirs. In 1869 he spoke of trade and com­
merce as "the most fruitful root" from which consolidation (Zusammenwach3
sen) of the North German Confederation could be expected. In this he was

' This remark was made in a cabinet meeting of Mar. 14, 1869, which discussed whether to
situate the Superior Court of Commerce of the North German Confederation in Leipzig or Ber­
lin. Bismarck favored Leipzig, arguing that to locate the court in Saxony would conciliate its
citizens and help "consolidate the entire confederation." This prospect outweighed the disadvan­
tage of separating the nation's highest court from the principal seat of government. DZA Merseburg, Rep. 90a, B, III, 2b, Nr. 6, vol. 81.

wiser than he knew. Within the frontiers of the empire the German sense of
nationhood was consolidated by the continuing growth of industry, the increase and redistribution of population, the new technology of transportation
and communication, the steady expansion of German capitalism and of interlocking relationships between giant banks and industrial enterprises. What
Bismarck's diplomatic talents and the striking power of the Prussian army created was chiefly consolidated by the activities of German businessmen and
laborers.
At the same time the social transformation wrought by industrialization
also produced new fissures in German society that the Bismarck regime could
not close. The German nation-state became divided internally by conflicting
social interests and their matching ideologies, producing fears as well as anticipations of the civil conflict that finally erupted after 1018. But in other respects economic growth tended to consolidate the national union, to bind the
nation together with new sinews of self-interest and psychological cohesion.
Their cumulative effect was to reduce the significance of internal political
boundaries and to build a sense of nationhood that transcended, though it did
not extinguish, the particularistic sentiments of an earlier epoch. It is not too
much to say that within one decade this economic consolidation made irreversible by any ordinary means what had been decided in 1866-1871. What
had been accomplished by political acumen and military prowess could no
longer be undone—except by political stupidity and military catastrophe.
Growing social and ideological divisions coupled with increasing economic
and national consolidation—such was the paradox of Germany's Second
Reich.
Germany Enters the Industrial Age
After three decades of acceleration German industrialization reached a momentum during the period of unification that was maintained thereafter despite temporary setbacks. The construction of railways, the main propulsive
force during the period of acceleration, reached a grand climax in the early
1870s, by which time the major lines had been built. Although the building
of local lines remained important in the German economy until the end of
the century, other sectors now assumed the primary burden of sustaining the
growth achieved. By 1870 German textile manufacturers had made the transition from hand to mechanical spinning. The acquisition of Alsace-Lorraine,
furthermore, doubled the number of spindles operating in Germany. While
slower in development, mechanical weaving surged ahead in the 1860s and
1870s. The armament, machine, and machine tool industries reached a level
equal to and even superior to the products of foreign competitors (except in
farm machinery where the United States was preeminent). During the 1880s
public utilities—gas, water, sewers, and streetcars—played a major role in the

construction industry. The same period saw a great expansion in German
shipbuilding. By the end of the century two new industries—chemicals and
electrical equipment—had appeared in which Germany excelled in both in­
novation and production. These several expanding industries perpetuated the
growth previously derived chiefly from railway construction.4
Despite temporary reverses, German heavy industry set new production
records, decade after decade. Coal and pig iron were joined by steel at midcentury, as the invention of new furnaces (by Bessemer in 1856, SiemensMartin in 1866, and Gilchrist Thomas in 1878) opened the way to its mass
production. Because it removed phosphorous from iron ore, the last of these
processes was particularly important for Germany, which was scantily en­
dowed with nonphosphorous ores. Although familiar, the advancing statistics
(in millions of tons) are still worth pondering.

By Bismarck's death in 1898 Germany had surpassed France and Belgium to
become the continent's leading industrial power. By 1914 it had also sur­
passed Britain and was, after the United States, the second industrial nation
of the world.5
Despite massive emigration (4,875,300 between 1840 and 1900), Germany
also surpassed France to become in Bismarck's time the most populous country
in Europe except for Russia. A new wave of fecundity (following that which
climaxed in the 1830s) arrived in the 1860s with a steep increase in the an­
nual birth rate that tapered off in the 1870s as new methods of birth control
were introduced. Thereafter the birthrate fell, but so did the deathrate. Im­
proved nourishment, sanitation, and medical services increased the average
life span. Total population attained 40,059,000 in 1871, 45,234,000 in 1880,
49,428,000 in 1890, and 56,367,000 in 1900. Naturally industrialization pro­
duced great changes in the occupations and distribution of this population.
Whereas 51 percent of the working force was still employed in agriculture,
forestry, and fisheries during the 1860s, as against 28 percent in industrial
pursuits, the figures were 38 percent against 37 percent in 1900.6 Between

1871 and 1910 the population of rural areas (parishes with less than 2,000
inhabitants) sank from 63.9 percent to 29.9 percent, while that of the big
cities (over 100,000 inhabitants) rose from 4.8 percent to 21.3 percent.7 The
rural population remained fairly stable in total numbers (about 26,000,000)
as the towns absorbed almost all of the increase. Berlin had 826,341 inhabitants in 1870, 1,578,794 in 1890, and 1,888,848 by 1900. Its nearest competitor, the seaport of Hamburg, grew from 239,107 to 705,738 during these
three decades. What industrialization meant to the Ruhr region can be judged
by the expansion of Essen from 51,513 to 118,862 and Dusseldorf from 69,365
to 213,711 persons in the same period.8
The tensions in German society were heightened by the vagaries of the
business cycle. The wave of prosperity and expansion in world capitalism that
began in the 1840s mounted, with brief interruptions in 1858-1861 and
1866-1868, to a grand climax in 1873. During the early years of the Kulturkampf, of Bismarck's collaboration with the liberals, and of his quarrel with
ultraconservatives, Germany was absorbed in a business boom of extraordinary proportions. For example, pig iron consumption rose from 1,374,000
tons (35.8 kilograms per capita) in 1869 to 2,954,000 tons (71.5 kilograms
per capita) in 1873, while its price increased from 66.2 to 145.5 marks per
ton. Wholesale prices for industrial products generally escalated by 40 percent. The entire capitalist system experienced this trend and these fluctuations, but the final ascent of 1871-1873 was particularly steep in Germany.
Several factors were responsible: the removal in 1870 of restrictions on formation of joint-stock companies; the general optimism engendered by the
long rise in output during preceding decades, the exhilaration following victory over France and fulfillment of national unity; and the inflationary effect
of the 5 billion francs paid by the French as a war indemnity, part of which
was used to liquidate the debts of the federal states. Optimism, speculation,
and fraud were rampant as millions of citizens from scullery maids to titled
aristocrats gambled in securities. The first sign of danger, a crash on the Vienna bourse on May 9, 1873, went unheeded in Germany. In October the
overburdened house of paper came tumbling down.»

ism, the exact nature of which is still in dispute. Following the business cycle
theories of Nikolay Kondratieff, Joseph Schumpeter, and Arthur Spiethoff it
has been popular to dub the period 1873 to 1896 that of the "great depression," a downward "long wave" in economic development that followed and
preceded upward waves of approximately the same duration."° Further research has shown, however, that the downward "trend period" of 1873-1896
cannot be verified empirically. Although prices fluctuated on a lower plane,
industrial output grew steadily after 1879, as German entrepreneurs constantly consolidated, rationalized, and modernized the processes of production. Real wages soon surpassed the peak of 1873-1875 and continued to
ascend until 1900. From 1873 to 1893 the number of employed persons grew
by 28 percent, the net domestic product (at standard prices) by 58 percent,
an expansion that compares favorably with the 36 and 68 percent achieved
in the next twenty years.11 Though the long waves are now disputed, no authority questions that the period 1873-1894 was marked by repeated fluctuations of short duration. We shall see that the brevity of the upswings and
longevity of the downswings during 1879-1894 bred a mood of insecurity and
pessimism among businessmen that spread out into the society at large.12
The agrarian sector of the German economy was in even deeper trouble.
During the late 1870s the golden age of German agriculture, which began in
the 1830s, commenced to fade. For three decades population growth, urban
development, the Zollverein, railway transport, and flourishing exports had
produced high prices and profits, particularly for the big landowners in the
east. Production expanded steadily as new acreage was put to the plow and
the Thaer technique of crop rotation delivered increased yields. By 1865,
however, most of the arable land was under cultivation, and the Thaer system
had attained optimum benefits. There followed a period of relative stagnation
in production that lasted until after 1890, when chemical fertilizers became
common. In animal production alone significant increases were achieved in
these years, and this was made possible only by importing fodder. Before the
1860s agrarian production had increased at a more rapid rate than did population, creating surpluses that trans-Elbian producers sold in foreign markets.
But after 1870 the relationship of food supply to population reversed, creating
a problem of food supply that required imports; Germany had more mouths
than its farmers could feed. ' 3

We shall see that this problem was solved by massive imports of foreign
grain and other foodstuffs from Russia, North America, and the Argentine. I4
What was beneficial to the urban masses spelled disaster for German agriculture. The flood of grain produced by American farmers on cheap, virgin soil
and transported at low cost by railway and steamship depressed prices in European grain markets during the 1870s. The German market was sheltered for
a time, but it too began to feel the effects of new competition in the following
decade. Stagnating production, high costs, and declining prices produced an
agrarian crisis in Germany of serious proportions.
Bismarck unified Germany in a period of general prosperity in agriculture
and industry. During most of the rest of his chancellorship he was compelled
to govern in a period of economic difficulty in both areas. It was a period,
furthermore, that saw a fundamental redistribution of financial and social
power in Germany. Falling prices compelled heavy industrialists to cut costs
by expanding their facilities and increasing production. Through mergers and
takeovers large firms absorbed the smaller. Heavy industry and big banking
established their dominance over light industry and mercantile interests. The
relative weight of industrial and agrarian capital shifted steadily in favor of
the former. Factory labor continued to expand in numbers and prosperity relative to artisan labor. Again the question arose: could the old Prussian-German establishment adjust to the new facts of economic and social life? Could
it assimilate the new entrepreneurial elite of heavy industry and high finance
and could it prevent the alienation of industrial labor?
During Bismarck's chancellorship Germany made enormous strides in that
process of transformation that historians have come to call "modernization."
The sheer weight of economic, technological, and population growth contributed in powerful ways to the consolidation of the union he had created by
political and military means. Older cleavages of the kind that the Germans
called "particularism"—those based on regional peculiarities, historical
traditions, dynastic loyalties, and religious affiliation—tended to diminish
without disappearing. They were superseded in importance by newer or deepened cleavages of an economic and social nature—based on occupation, interest groups, social status, and class identification. The attack on political
Catholicism during the 1870s (the Kulturkampf) is evidence of the lingering
existence of the older divisions in German society; the assault on social democracy after 1878 (the antisocialist statute) and the shift from free trade to
protectionism (tariff act of 1879) testify to the new. The older cleavages had

threatened the achievement and perpetuation of German unity; the newer
ones jeopardized the stability of the social-political order.

Demographic Consolidation
As long as water remained the chief mode of transport, Germany had no
natural center of commerce and population comparable to London or Paris.
In contrast to the river systems of Britain and France, those of central Europe
tended to divert rather than concentrate the life of the people. The Danube
turned Austrian Germans toward the Slavic regions in the southeast; the
Rhine linked southwestern Germany to the low countries; the Weser, Elbe,
Oder, and Vistula oriented the northern population toward the Baltic and
North Seas. Mountainous areas between the river systems made it difficult to
connect their upper basins through canals, whose construction was further
hampered by political disunion. Germany did not inherit a system of Roman
roads such as were the birthright of England and France. Not until the 1840s
did it begin to overcome this handicap by constructing gravel or "metalled"
roads. Although 30,000 kilometers of such roads were built by 1857, their
immediate value was to expand the trading radius of the cities; they did not
provide a national system of communication. The long-distance transport of
heavy goods such as coal, iron, and grain was prohibitively expensive.I5
The construction of railways solved the problem of transport dramatically
within two generations. The length of German lines in kilometers reached
14,776 in 1865, 29,970 in 1875, 37,571 in 1885, and 46,500 in 1895. l6 Almost from the moment of its invention shrewd observers foresaw the potential
of the railway for knitting together the German nation. Goethe's remark to
Eckermann in 1828 is often cited: "I have no fear that Germany will not
become united; our good roads and future railroads will do their part."' 7 During the 1830s Friedrich List urged construction of a nationwide rail network
as the "Siamese twin" of the Zollverein; together, he predicted, they would
unite the German people into a great, wealthy, cultured, and powerful nation.18 Looking backward during the 1880s, Heinrich von Treitschke judged
that the railway was a mixed blessing. On the one hand, the conquest of space
had produced a new appreciation of material values and an unprecedented
drive for gain and pleasure; by throwing the social classes together, mass trans' ' Karl Lamprecht, Deutsche Geschichte der j'ungsten Vergangenheit und Gegenwart (Berlin,

port had obscured social distinctions and superficially enlarged the horizon
and knowledge of the average man. On the other hand, the railway had also
closed the gap in Germany between intellectual greatness and economic poverty and had built a material foundation for the growing political power of the
nation. When Germany could be crossed at its narrowest point in three hours,
the common man became conscious of the "whole lying vileness" of the German small states; "he began to comprehend what it meant to be a great nation." Borders lost their significance and prejudices declined, once the Germans had "the good fortune to know each other."'9
To what degree the new age of transport actually had the psychological
effect before 1870 that Goethe and List prophesied and Treitschke presumed
is difficult to say. Travel and personal contact can sometimes heighten more
than diminish local patriotism and awareness of cultural differences. In all
probability the railway made its greatest contribution to cultural fusion within
Germany by making feasible the mass migration and resettlement of millions
of people. Before unification legal and political barriers restricted this movement. After 1867 they were leveled by a series of legislative acts, the most
important of which were the statutes of 1867 on freedom of migration (Freiziigigkeit) and of 1870 on poor relief (Indigenat). The former established the
right of citizens to migrate, settle, obtain property, and enter business in all
parts of the North German Confederation; the latter granted the right of poor
relief to migrants, although limiting it to those over twenty-four years of age
who had resided for two years in the district where aid was sought. As
amended by the Reichstag, the latter statute made confederate rather than
state citizenship the criterion for claiming welfare aid, a provision that seriously breached the federal character of the union. Other laws that significantly eased migration were the abolition of compulsory passports (1867),
prohibition of marriage on the basis of residence, income, poverty, occupation, and Jewish faith (1868), imprisonment for debt (1868), restrictions on
incorporation (1870), and double taxation (1870).2° These statutes were
among the important fruits of Bismarck's collaboration with the National Liberal party, which valued their integrative effect. Almost every exercise of its
legislative power, for that matter, brought the central government into direct
contact with the citizens, heightening its impact upon their daily lives.
The constitution of 1867 and a citizenship statute (1870) established dual
citizenship. Confederate citizenship depended on the gain or loss of state citizenship, a fact that made the latter ostensibly more important. Yet state citizenship steadily lost significance under a statute of 1870 that made citizenship

a matter of residence, descent, and application.21 "A German professor,"
wrote Heinrich Triepel, "who is much in demand and often 'called' can with
ease gradually acquire eight or more state citizenships, of which eventually
most are completely devoid of importance to him. His sons inherit them all
in the cradle and, unless they should happen to study jurisprudence, they do
not know how wealthy they are in 'fatherlands'. . . . In a few generations all
of this will be still much more obscure and confused. State citizenship is being
swallowed up by Reich citizenship."22
Cheap and swift transport by railway, the removal of legal barriers, and the
promise of a better livelihood led millions of Germans to migrate. By 1907
28,982,807 of Germany's total population (60,378,235) were no longer living
in the communities of their birth; of these migrants 20,041,373 were born in
the same province or state in which they resided, while 8,941,433 were born
outside it. Considering the probable number of persons who had migrated and
died before 1907, it is estimated that between 22 and 24 million persons had
moved from one region to another since i860. The growing industrial centers
drew most of their migrants from the surrounding region; the larger the city
the wider the hinterland from which they came. But many also came from
distant regions. The most striking instance was the east-to-west current that
began in the 1860s and mounted with each decade. After the last arable lands
had been plowed around 1865 and agrarian difficulties began in the 1870s,
the farms and latifundia of eastern Prussia could no longer absorb the growing
work force produced by Germany's most fecund birthrate. The "flight from
the land" (East and West Prussia, Silesia, Posen, and Pomerania) began, first
to Berlin and after 1880 to the Ruhr. (Many had a still more distant goal—
the open prairies and growing cities of the American Midwest.) According to
the census of 1907, 95 percent of the migrants from the northeast to the Ruhr
city of Gelsenkirchen were peasants who became wage laborers. But not all
migrants were low on the social scale. Some were public employees whose
place of work was prescribed by the state, while others were entrepreneurs
drawn to the big cities by opportunities for their capital and talent. The same
census shows that 70 percent of the small group of migrants to Munich from
the northeast were bourgeois. Of the sixteen important industrialists who
were presidents of the Elberfeld-Barmen chamber of commerce between 1831
and 1917, more than half were first (6) or second (4) generation migrants—
this in a city noted for its continuity of economic development and its pronounced sense of tradition.23

Internal migrations increased the disparity in population between the
agrarian east and industrial west. By 1910 the Rhine province, Westphalia,
and Saxony had more inhabitants than did the entire Reich in 1871. The
highest population density was reached in the Rhine province, where 67 percent of the population lived in urban areas (more than half in large cities) in
contrast to East Prussia's 27 percent. During these four decades the population
of Westphalia increased by more than 600 percent, the Rhine province by
247 percent, Saxony by 237 percent, Baden by 261 percent, East Prussia by
155 percent. 24 Out of the reshuffling and restructuring of German society
there emerged in the great centers of population a sense of regional identification based on real and imagined characteristics of dialect, mores, and temperament that distinguished them from other Germans. "Berliner" and "Hamburger" came to connote in the popular mind peoples as distinct in speech and
character traits as Saxons, Swabians, or Badenese. The new urban-industrial
region in the west became a giant crucible that fused those arriving from the
east with the native population to produce, according to Wilhelm Brepohl, a
new German VoUisstamm, the Ruhrvolk of Rhineland-Westphalia, in which
the east German dominated biologically, the west German culturally.25 The
arrival in significant numbers of Polish peasants (30,000 by 1890, 300,000 by
1910), on the other hand, created an ethnic minority that the western cities
could not soon assimilate.26

Financial Consolidation
The growth in industrial output and steadily thickening network of transport
and communication were accompanied by an expansion and concentration of
German business enterprise. While it inhibited, German political disunity
had never blocked the migration of capital between states and regions in Germany. The growth of the joint-stock company and of new investment opportunities during 1850-1870 greatly increased the flow. In contrast to the

United States, the doctrine of laissez-faire was never applied in Germany
against monopolies and the concentration of economic power. Here its goals
were lower tariffs and reduced government paternalism, not the guarantee of
competition and protection of small producers. By actively engaging in company promotion, moreover, the German corporate banks furthered the amalgamation of banking and industrial capital and hence the accumulation of
economic power in the hands of a relatively small number of firms and individuals. The center of this new, interlocking financial structure was Berlin,
which became the financial as well as political capital of united Germany. Its
basic axis was on Prussian soil extending from Berlin westward to the Ruhr
and eastward to Upper Silesia. This became the armature around which the
business life of Germany revolved.27
The expansion and concentration were made possible by the joint-stock,
or corporate, form of business enterprise. As in other countries, this proved
to be the only form of business organization capable of accumulating the enormous supplies of capital needed for German industrialization during the middle decades. As has been shown, the Prussian state had earlier (through its
power to charter and supervise corporate enterprises) severely restricted use
of the joint-stock company in industry and nearly prohibited its use in banking.28 Even so, 397 joint-stock companies capitalized at 3,043,000,000 marks
were founded in Prussia between 1826 and June 1870. An early fruit of liberal
collaboration with Bismarck was the statute of June n , 1870, which abolished controls on incorporation. The result was a rush to incorporate (928
firms capitalized at 2,781,000,000 marks during 1871-1873) and, after the
crash of 1873, to amalgamate and consolidate. The Grundetfahre saw the final
victory of the corporate over the partnership and single-ownership forms of
business organization.29
The virtual prohibition of corporate banks in Prussia before 1870 favored
private banking houses, particularly in Berlin, Cologne, and Frankfurt. But it
also contributed to the growth of a few joint-stock or commandite banks
founded during the period of the German "takeoff," namely, the Schaafhausen'scher Bankverein at Cologne (1848), Disconto-GeseUschaft at Berlin (1851),
DarmstMter Bank (1853), Berliner HandehgeseUschaft (1856), and Mitteldeutscher Kreditverein at Meiningen (1856). The fact that the Disconto-GeseUschaft
and Berliner Handehgesellschaft had to be organized on a commandite basis
(composed of active partners with unlimited liability and inactive partners
with limited liability) did not prevent their growth. Under David and Adolf

Hansemann the Disconto-Gesettschaft became Germany's strongest bank. During the 1860s it led the "Prussian consortium," a syndicate of corporate and
private banks that did a profitable business in floating Prussian state loans,
beginning with the mobilization loan of 1859. The consortium extended its
operations to the financing of industry and was of "decisive importance" for
the further development of banking credit in Prussia and Germany. "Henceforth the Prussian consortium not only regulated and directed the traffic in
state and local government securities but also established the financial and
bank-technical foundation for the later industrial growth of Germany, for its
capital exports and thereby for its world economic position."30
Capital and management for the new corporate and commandite banks
were originally supplied by private banking houses. Yet the private banks were
increasingly overshadowed after 1870 by the giants to which their investments had given life. Their clientele, mostly aristocratic, was limited and
likewise their capital resources. They were unable to supply the massive outlay
of capital needed for industrial expansion during 1871-^72 or to absorb the
shocks of the decline that followed. The largest and best connected (for example, Schickler, Bleichroder, Warschauer, Mendelssohn, Oppenheim, and
Rothschild-Frankfurt) survived and continued to prosper. But they were compelled to limit their major flotations to government loans and leave the more
risky business of company promotion to the great corporate banks. As the
bankers of princes and ministers and as the underwriters of government bond
issues they maintained close connections with the ruling establishment and
came to be among its principal supporters and beneficiaries.31
Both the boom and bust of the 1870s furthered the growth and dominance of a few great corporate banks. During the Grunderjahre the DiscontoGesellschaft and some other banks established subsidiaries with numerous
branches throughout the country. The Provinzial-Discontogesellschaft, for example, opened offices in Hanover, Bernburg, Strassburg, Hamburg, Duisburg,
Braunschweig, Hameln, Ludwigshafen, and Halle. The subsidiaries did not
survive the depression and their liquidation in the late 1870s interrupted the
first attempt to create nationwide banking networks. During these years, nevertheless, the larger banks extended their business radius and clientele by absorbing many of the new corporate banks created by the boom. Two new
major banks, the Deutsche Bank at Berlin (1870) and Dresdner Bank (1872),
whose managements avoided speculative excesses during the boom, were particularly active in taking over distressed enterprises. By various devices—
branches, agencies, affiliates, corporate and commandite subsidiaries—the
larger banks (except for the Berliner HandehgeseUschaft, whose operations re30

mained centralized) expanded their influence during the 1880s. Already out­
classed in capital resources, the private banks and smaller corporate banks
were now surpassed in breadth and depth of organizational structure, in the
variety of services they could offer, and hence in the capacity to develop new
business.32
Its position at the center of government and at the hub of the German
railway system assured that Berlin would also become a center of industry and
finance. After the 1840s it became important for machine manufacture (Julius
Freund and Franz Egells) and locomotives (August Borsig), later for electrical
equipment (Werner Siemens and Johann Halske) and chemicals (Ernst
Schering and Samuel Kunheim). The concentration of so many industrial
and mercantile enterprises, businessmen, and wage earners naturally pre­
sented excellent opportunities for banks. But Berlin was also the seat of many
Prussian and imperial offices significant for public finance, including the
semipublic Prussian Bank, Prussia's principal bank of issue, and the Prussian
Seehandlung through which government funds were channeled into private
undertakings of public interest. During the period of accelerated industriali­
zation the Prussian Bank commenced (some say in 1857, others 1866) to as­
sume central banking functions as the principal depository of government
funds and the lender of last resort to other banks.33
The foundations of what has been called the Ruhr-Berlin-Upper Silesia
financial axis were laid in the prosperous years 1850-1856 when Berlin's
major banks (Disconto-Gesellschaft, Berliner Handelsgesellschaft, and S. Bleichroder) financed railway enterprises connecting the capital with the rapidly
developing industrial areas in the east and west. Until 1870, however, scar­
city of capital prevented all but the Disconto-Gesellschaftfromextending its
engagements significantly in the Ruhr. Hence the financial organization of
heavy industry remained largely local. But this changed dramatically in the
boom years 1871-1873. Leading entrepreneurs of the Ruhr and Silesia (for
example, Friedrich Grillo, William Mulvaney, Count Guido Henckel von
Donnersmarck) turned to Berlin for the funding of the mergers, reorganiza­
tions, expansions, and new enterprises that marked those busy years. Most of
the 174 corporations (capitalized at 613,000,000 thalers) founded in the Ger­
man iron and coal industry during 1871-1874 were financed in Berlin. Indus­
trial securities overtook railway shares as major objects of investment and

speculation on the Berlin bourse and even threatened the hitherto leading
role of Prussian state bonds.34
The war of 1866 and its consequences brought Berlin capitalists a long step
closer to financial hegemony over southern Germany. The political and financial eclipse of Frankfurt occurred almost simultaneously. In the past the
large private banks of Frankfurt, principally the Rothschilds, had been the
chief suppliers of credit to south German governments. Since i860 Rothschild had also possessed an official monopoly of the flotation of Prussian bonds
in the south. But the business recession of 1866 followed by the threat of war
produced a financial crisis in Germany that made it impossible for Rothschild
to continue this function. Hence the Prussian government turned for war
credits to the Prussian consortium. But the Frankfurt bankers were also unable
to underwrite the war loans of south German governments, compelling them
to resort to local banks and to the sale of government-owned railway shares
at a poor price. The crisis sharply revealed the limited reserves of the south
German money market. "After 1866 southern Germany began to cover its
financial needs directly in Berlin."35
The Frankfurt bourse suffered a similar fate. At mid-century, when the sale
of government securities was still the chief business of stock exchanges, the
Frankfurt exchange was the most important in Germany. By the 1860s, however, railway shares had become the lifeblood of the securities business, and
most were launched on the Berlin bourse, as were the increasing number of
industrial securities in the 1870s. By century's end the corporate stocks listed
on the Berlin exchange numbered 698, compared with Frankfurt's 301, Dresden's 133, Hamburg's 125, and Leipzig's 93. After 1870 the Frankfurt bourse
was badly outdistanced by its Berlin counterpart, which became one of the
leading stock exchanges of the world.36
To many southerners this new financial dependency upon Berlin was objectionable^—as distasteful as the commercial dependency created by the ZoIlverein and the political and military dependency resulting from the war of
1866. In order to escape it, their governments strove in the years 1866-1870
to build up their own banking institutions. Yet these newfirmswere weak and
their efforts to create new money by questionable financial practices added to
the inflation of the boom years after 1870. Nor did Hamburg, Germany's principal port, succeed in establishing its supremacy in international banking.
When a group of Hamburg bankers founded an Internationale Bank in 1870,
Berlin financiers reacted immediately by establishing the Deutsche Bank (a
symptomatic title) with branches in Hamburg, Bremen, London, Shanghai,

and Yokohama. Although compelled to expand its domestic operations with
the decline in foreign trade after 1873, the Deutsche Bank commanded the
field of international payments and credits to exports. The magnetic attraction of the Berlin money market is shown by the migration of the Darmstadter
Bank to the Prussian capital after 1871. The management of the Dresdner
Bank, originally established to nourish the growth of Saxon industry, decided
in 1876 over vigorous protests by Saxon stockholders to erect a branch office
in Berlin, which became after 1881 its center of operations. Even the Schaafhausen'scher Bankverein, whose business had remained largely concentrated in
the Ruhr, moved its headquarters from Cologne to Berlin after 1891. Failure
to migrate to Berlin cost the Mitteldeutscher Kreditverein, on the other hand,
its position as one of Germany's six leading banks.37
The capstone of the German banking system was the Reichsbank established by law in 1875 as a semipublic bank of issue that absorbed the Prussian
Bank. While technically not a joint-stock bank, the Reichsbank was legally a
corporation. Its capital of 120,000,000 marks was supplied by private investors; its management, by state officials under Bismarck's authority as the
Reich chancellor. At the time of the Rei^bank's founding, thirty-two German banks had the right to issue paper money; their banknotes were worth
130,000,000 marks as against the Reichsbank's 250,000,000 marks. By the end
of 1876, fourteen had surrendered the privilege; by 1900, all but seven. Their
note circulation was 175,000,000 marks in contrast to the Reichsbank's
1,138,000,000 marks. Branches of the Reichsbank were established throughout the country, numbering 330 by 1900. Although not engaged in company
promotion, the Reichsbank cultivated other aspects of banking business, including deposits, "giro" accounts, Lombard loans, and discounting of bills.
Most importantly, it assumed central banking functions for all Germany, being the final source of credit for other banks and controlling through its discount rate the general cost of credit and the flow of gold to and from foreign
countries.38 With the Reichsbank, furthermore, Germany took the final step
in creating a unified currency. Earlier statutes had prepared the way by establishing the mark as the basic currency unit (1871) and restricting its convertibility to gold (1873). When France, the United States, and other countries
followed suit, gold became an international standard, with considerable benefits for the expansion of world trade. These reforms were among the most
important fruits of Bismarck's collaboration with the national liberals. Germany had achieved a single currency and an interdependent banking system

embracing the entire country, a major gain for the consolidation of the Reich
and a basic guarantee of its continued unity.39
A unique feature of the German banking system, one that favored concentration of capital and economic power, was the active participation of the
great corporate banks in the founding and expansion of industrial enterprises.
From their inception the Schaafhausenscher Bankverein, Darmstadter Bank,
Disconto-Gesellschaft, and Berliner HandehgeseRschaft were designed for this
function. While this practice was to be found among major banks everywhere,
German banks carried it to an extreme by making company promotion their
principal business. In this they resembled the French Credit Mobilier rather
than their British and American counterparts. They specialized in long-term
loans, both secured and unsecured, and in underwriting capital issues for industrial and commercial enterprises. Frequently they held in their portfolios,
either for investment or speculation, large blocks of stocks and bonds that
gave them an important and even decisive voice in the management of the
firms involved. But the reverse was also true—firms to which long-term loans
were made or in which the banks had large investments were often represented on the directorates of the banks. "The interrelations between banks
and industries fostered the process of concentration in both fields. In the
course of its rapid growth, industry shifted its weight more and more from the
smaller and medium-sized companies to those firms which by their nature required huge capital investments, such as the heavy industries, the electrical
industries, and shipbuilding. It became increasingly necessary that large, efficient, and rich banks exist to shoulder the task of industrial financing. Thus
industrial concentration became a powerful incentive to banking concentration."40 The result was a degree of interdependence between banking and
industrial capital, between big banks and big industries, unknown elsewhere
in the capitalist world.
By the late 1870s the basic structure of German capitalism with its system
of interlocking financial relationships, and its concentration of industrial and
financial power along the line Rhine-Berlin-Silesia, had already been established. The German federal union had been welded together by material

bonds that only the most violent political or military events could sever. The
particularism of state and region gave way to social and ideological frictions
as the main source of divisiveness in German society.

Social Ckavage
The relocation of millions of people produced major problems of assimilation.
For those with capital or special talents the personal adjustment was probably
minor; for peasants and village artisans it is presumed to have been more dif­
ficult. Yet the transition from hoe and plow to machine and mine face may
have been less "traumatic" than the romanticizers of peasant life assumed.41
Most migrants were independent cottagers rather than hired hands on the
latifundia of the gentry.42 They chose to swap the precarious existence of the
small farmer or village artisan for the more secure livelihood of an unskilled
mine or factory worker. What drew them to the city was the prospect of a
higher living standard: better pay, shorter hours, less exertion, and more in­
dependence, including the chance to found a family at a younger age. Fur­
thermore, the city offered the workingman far more diversion, the chance for
a more exciting life than was to be had in the isolated hamlets beyond the
Elbe. Not all ended in factories or underground in the coal seams; for every
worker in industry another was required to supply the many auxiliary services
of urban life.43
Like those who emigrated across the ocean, many who took the road to
Berlin and the Ruhr hoped to find there the chance to ascend to a higher rung
on the social ladder, an opportunity denied them and their children in the
rigidly stratified society of the east. Bismarck himself endorsed this dream,
asserting to the Reichstag that a peasant who went west might become a
Krupp or Borsig, whereas in the east he had no prospect of becoming a big
41

Without much empirical evidence concerning the actual life of rural immigrants to the
industrial towns, historians tend to presume that it was traumatic: "Industry provided work, but
nothing more. It judged the immigrant neither by origin nor family, but only by his ability to fit
into the economic process. Outside his place of work he was almost always left to himself as one
individual in the mass of individuals, while the rural or small-town world had embraced and
ordered him in all aspects of his life." Wilhelm Brepohl, lndustrievolk im Wandel von der agraren

property owner.44 But the historical record shows that the open frontier, free
or cheap land, and young towns of the American West offered to the Pomeranian or Mecklenburg peasant and village artisan a greater opportunity for
embourgeoisement—not only for themselves but also for their children and
grandchildren—than was to be found in the mines and mills of the Ruhr and
the factories of Berlin and other proliferating cities of western and southern
Germany. In both countries the emerging entrepreneurial elite of the lower
over-stratum (Oberschicht) of society was primarily recruited from the middlestratum (Mittehchicht); in Germany the percentage that came from the understratum (Unterschicfit), a small minority in the United States, was miniscule.
With few exceptions (notably Silesian aristocrats) Germany's entrepreneurs
came from its lower and upper middle-stratum, particularly merchants, small
industrialists, and higher officials (in both business and government). According to one estimate, nearly 45 percent stemmed from the intelligentsia
(BiUungsbiirgerturn) of the middle-stratum, an educated elite prepared by
training and experience to take advantage of the opportunities industrialization offered. Among those composing the under-stratum artisans had some
chance (a little better than 15 percent) for social ascent; mine and factory
workers, almost none (0.5 percent).45
A major reason for Germany's social immobility in the midst of economic
change was the continuing influence of social structures and attitudes inherited from earlier centuries. Industrialization changed and weakened but did
not liquidate the German estate (stdndische) mentality. It inhibited, with
some exceptions, the old landowning nobility (Adehstand) from becoming
bankers or industrialists and created a new entrepreneurial elite (Burgertum),
many of whom yearned for ennoblement. Proliferation of the middle-stratum
created a greatly enlarged and more diversified middle estate (Mitteistand); in
the under-stratum a growing body of mine and factory workers (Arbeiterstand)
stood beside the older peasant estate (Bauernstand), with which it shared a
common origin but few common interests. The persistence of the estate tradition in Germany from the age of absolutism to the mid-twentieth century—
despite the major changes in demographic, economic, and social structures
that attended the German industrial revolution—is an extraordinary phenomenon, which in its degree demarcates the German experience from that

of other western European countries. Such was the force of tradition that
social attitudes placing a greater value on social origin and status than on
talent and performance persisted through unconscious and sometimes conscious (both are evident in Bismarck) adaptation to changing material circumstances.+6
Population growth, urban development, internal migration, transition
from an agrarian to an industrial society, continuing transformation of the
social structure within the estate tradition—all produced an evident need for
new loyalties and systems of belief. Uprooted from his native soil with its
traditions, familial ties, and fixed social relationships, the individual naturally
groped for ideological convictions capable of supplying a new sense of security
and destiny. Some migratory groups of the upper Mittehtand—businessmen
whose affairs took them to distant cities, students who matriculated at remote
universities, professors who repeatedly responded to calls from other universities, state officials who were transferred from one region to another—often
became avid German nationalists. But the migrating east-Elbian peasant or
artisan, who had once gotten his Weltanschauung from the village pastor and
his politics from the local landlord and Landrat, tended as a proletarian to find
his new value system in socialism. Nationalism and socialism provided Germans with new spiritual bonds to replace those dissolved by economic and
social change. In this way the uprooted solved their "identity crises."47
The experience of the Anglo-Saxon world shows that it was by no means
inevitable that the working class in industrialized societies should have been
won to Marxian socialism in the nineteenth century. To determine why the
German experience was different is an acute problem in German social history. One line of investigation has focused on peculiarities in German religious and intellectual development that explain why neither the Protestant
church nor the "religion of German idealism" developed an interest in social
amelioration. German idealism has often been called the religion of the German intelligentsia. Because of its rejection of natural law, its doctrine of obedience to positive law, its view of the state as separate from civil society and
as embodying higher values, and its dedication to aesthetic individualism,
German idealism did not develop "a meaningful social ethic," only a "pluralistic ethic in terms of individual development." While other possibilities had

been evident in its early history and in the pietistic movement of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the Lutheran church had become identified
with authoritarian rule and with older occupational groups in German society—nobility, peasantry, and artisans. In accordance with their tradition Lutheran pastors spoke of faith but not of concrete problems of economic survival and social justice. Lutheranism no longer had relevance for urban
workers, who ceased to attend services and left their children unbaptized.-*8
By contrast, the Catholic church retained its appeal for a wide spectrum of
German society in the nineteenth century. Catholic intellectuals gave up the
attempt to harmonize Catholic doctrine with German idealism, resigned
themselves to remaining outside the mainstream of German intellectual life,
and cultivated all the more Catholicism's international character and connections. While allied with conservatives and even reactionary forces, the
Catholic church never surrendered its claim to sit in judgment over the social
and political policies of secular states.49 Hence it was in a better position than
German Protestantism to cope with the social effects of industrialization. In
southern and western Germany the Catholic church was able to construct and
consolidate a broadly based social and political alliance ranging from aristocrats to peasants and proletarians. Its success prevented the German working
class from developing a united front. Socialism flourished chiefly in Protestant
Germany. 5°
While the character of German idealism and Lutheran Protestantism presented barriers to social understanding and action, it was still not inescapable
that the formerly Protestant segment of German labor would turn to socialism
in search of new values and a new explanation of its situation and destiny.
Earlier it has been shown that important liberal and conservative leaders understood the political importance of winning and holding the allegiance of
the urban worker. Since the 1840s the pietistic Lutheran minister Johann
Wichern had sought not only the moral regeneration of the poor, but also
their social improvement; yet charity remained the primary social function of
the Inner Mission he founded. The attempts of the conservative Victor Aime
Huber to found housing, consumption, and savings bank cooperatives did not
thrive. While more successful, the cooperatives established by the left-liberal
Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch were limited in scope, and many proletarians

soon outgrew the educational societies (ArbeiterbiMungsvereine) that patron­
izing liberals established for their cultural improvement. In view of the failure
or limited success of private efforts at social reform, it seemed evident to both
Hermann Wagener, the conservative journalist and Prussian official, and to
the followers of the deceased Ferdinand Lassalle, the democrat who turned
socialist, that only the state could supply the initiative and resources for social
reform.51 It will be seen that this too was the conclusion of many "academic
socialists" (KathedersoziaUsten) of the 1870s and, belatedly, of Bismarck him­
self.'2

The Critical Decade in German Social Refotions:

1866-1875

The progress of industrialization during the third quarter of the nineteenth
century did not produce a general transformation of German society. The
transformed regions were those with major deposits of coal and iron ore, cities
favorably situated on old waterways and new railway networks, and towns
endowed with commercial and banking capital or good governmental con­
nections. And yet in 1871 almost 64 percent of Germany's population still
lived in villages of fewer than two thousand inhabitants. 53 Growth was re­
gionalized and uneven; likewise, its social effects. The bottom stratum of Ger­
man society did not yet contain a proletarian class of industrial wage earners
conscious of a common identity and a common cause. (Not until after 1900—
some think even later—did the mass "working class" of Marx's vision mate­
rialize.)54 In the mining towns, larger cities, and industrializing regions, nev­
ertheless, were growing pockets of wage earners who were at varying stages in
the evolution of proletarian class-consciousness. What happened within
those pockets during the last four decades of the nineteenth century was ex­
tremely important for the future of German social relations. In them were
initially hundreds, eventually thousands, of laborers who reached, albeit at
uneven tempo, the conviction that their future lay in self-help rather than in
further reliance upon the state for protection, existing political parties for
representation, and the men of "education and property" (Bildung una Besit?;)
in the upper level of the German Mittelstand for leadership.

in Germany was that of 1866-1875. What the government, political parties,
and employers did or did not offer in these years was decisive in determining
whether labor would be satisfied with its place in the German social order. In
the north German constitution of 1867 labor received the secret ballot in
national elections; during the years 1865-1869 it gained a limited right to
organize and strike.55 Whether urban labor would use the ballot to express
hostility toward the system appears to have depended upon whether it would
succeed in establishing labor unions and striking for the achievement of concrete, visible economic and social gains.
Although often circumvented, anticombination laws had existed for at
least two decades in the statute books of most German states. In Prussia both
employers and employees had been forbidden the right to organize in the industry code (Gewerbeordnung) of 1845 and subsequent ordinances of 1849 and
1851. Saxony's repeal of the anticombination law in 1861 led to increasing
criticism of the prohibition in Prussia. Liberal deputies (Julius Faucher and
Schulze-Delitzsch) and some industrialists (including Borsig, Freund, Siemens, Halske) argued for the right to organize on various grounds: since employers' "combinations" were less visible and never prosecuted, workers were
justified in regarding the prohibition as discriminatory and oppressive; the
prohibition was an unjustifiable and harmful interference by government in
the economic process, leading workers to believe that their wages were held
down and general welfare inhibited by the state and not the natural law of the
marketplace; since labor was a commodity, its value could only be determined
by the law of supply and demand in a free market.56 Prussian officials in industrial regions shared these convictions, as did Bismarck himself. Like them,
Bismarck did not expect repeal to increase greatly the number of labor unions
or work stoppages. Strikes were expensive and unions would require time to
accumulate funds. Workers would consider the issues and measure their
chances for success with care. Caution would prevail.57
These views, derived from the writings of Frederic Bastiat and John Stuart
Mill, were propagated by leaders of the Progressive party during the Prussian
constitutional conflict. The perennial attempts (beginning in 1862) of
Faucher, Schulze-Delitzsch, and others to gain parliamentary approval of a
bill legalizing labor unions (with some restrictions) popularized the issue and

educated labor as to its significance. By 1864-1865 conservatives (Hermann
Wagener, Moritz von Blanckenburg), socialists (Wilhelm Liebknecht, Ferdinand Lassalle), and Catholics (Bishop Ketteler, August Reichensperger) were
contesting the progressives' monopoly of the cause. The competition for
worker support in the constitutional struggle between crown and parliament
aroused the participation of the workers themselves; in assemblies and petitions they called for the unrestricted right to organize. This demand exceeded
the intentions even of the progressives. In February 1865 the Bismarck government seized control of the issue by sending Minister of Commerce Count
Heinrich von Itzenplitz to inform the Chamber of Deputies that, although
the cabinet accepted the need to legalize unions, abolition of anticombination laws could only take place as part of a general reform of the industry code
of 1845, a reform that would require preparatory consultations and enquiries
within and outside the government. One year later, the government introduced a bill that would have permitted worker coalitions for industrial, agricultural, and household workers. But the war of 1866 interrupted the deliberations and, furthermore, altered the balance of social and political forces in
Prussia and northern Germany. Although it granted the right to organize and
strike, the industry code of the North German Confederation (1869) kept
important restrictions: open shop, freedom to cancel union membership,
criminal penalties for coercion of nonstrikers, and no corporate legal status
for unions.*8
After Itzenplitz's declaration of 1865 the Prussian government ceased to
enforce anticombination laws, which adept labor leaders had in any case
learned to circumvent. During the 1860s workers in some trades (printers and
tobacco workers led) had revived the abortive movement of 1848-1849 for
the creation of local, regional, and finally national occupational associations
(Berufsvereine). This popular movement paralleled the phenomenal growth of
bourgeois "voluntary associations" in the same decade. Socialist and socialliberal "worker politicians" founded labor organizations, basins with which to
catch the current. In 1868-1869 were founded the Lassallean Allgemeiner
deutscher Arbeiterschaftsverband (Johann Baptist von Schweizer), the Marxistoriented Deutsche Gewerksgenossenschaften (August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht), and the progressive Verband der deutschen Gewerkvereine (Max
Hirsch and Franz Duncker).59 At issue in the competition between these or' 8 DZAMerseburg, Rep. 120, BB, I, 1, Nr. 12, Vols. 1-3; SBHA (1865), I1 119-202; Heinrich

ganizations was whether German workers would be integrated into bourgeois
society (the objective of the Hirsch-Duncker movement) or alienated from it
(the objective of the socialist movements). Could the Prussian-German establishment, broadened in these years to include the entrepreneurial elite and
German intelligentsia, be widened further to include the industrial working
class? Or would German workers conclude from bitter experience that the
Marxian concept of the "class struggle" was not mere theory but also a concrete reality with which they had to cope in daily life?
The dramatic events in foreign affairs that led to German unification in
18 70-1871 have overshadowed and tended to obscure parallel events in German economic and social history that were no less important. The climactic
acceleration in German economic development that occurred in i860-1873
has already been described. Less well known is the fact that the Grimderjahre
was accompanied by a wave of strikes and work stoppages that far exceeded
in frequency, breadth, and seriousness those of any previous period in nineteenth-century Germany. The number and duration of such interruptions increased in tempo with the boom. Of 805 strikes between 1864 and 1873, 222
occurred in 1873 alone. A wide variety of industries was affected, including
mining, smelting, machinery, textiles, building, and the artisan trades. Some
strikes involved only a few individuals; others, hundreds and even thousands.
No less than twenty-one thousand miners went on strike in the Ruhr region
in 1872.6°
For laborers, as for businessmen, the Grunde^ahre appeared to present unparalleled opportunities for material gain. The rapid acceleration of business
activity in the years 1869 to 1873 produced a labor shortage, a sharp increase
in labor's real earnings, and a determination by workers to seek a greater share
in the prosperity their labor produced.61 The most frequent demands of the
strikers were for pay increases, ranging from 10 to 60 percent (usually 25 percent), and a reduction of the working day from eleven and twelve to ten hours

(and restoration of the eight-hour day in mines). But there were other demands, including union recognition, guarantees for collective bargaining, reinstatement of fired labor leaders, control over work supervisors and employment practices, abolition of fines, and "better and more humane treatment."
Most strikes were local and spontaneous. Some small strikes were successful,
but the largest—the miners' strikes at Schweidnitz (Waldenburg) in 1869 and
in Silesia and the Ruhr region in 1872—were failures. Actual violence was
minimal, despite many threats and some actions against nonstrikers and
strikebreakers.62
Many work stoppages were nipped in the bud by employers, who either
threatened to discharge or actually discharged workers (particularly "agitators") making "unacceptable demands." In other cases, according to a German Commercial Association report, the strikers soon returned to work after
being "enlightened about their interests" by employers. Where these tactics
did not work, employers imported workers "in order to avoid any negotiations
with the strikers and any concessions." To the same end production was
shifted to other plants; "a very effective measure proved to be the substitution
of machine for handicraft production." In the major strikes at Waldenburg,
Essen, and elsewhere employers collaborated by refusing any concessions, instituting lockouts, blacklisting discharged employees, identifying and exchanging information on strike leaders, and by providing mutual help in filling the most pressing orders. In general, the employers also had the assistance
of the government, which on occasion sent the police, gendarmes, and soldiers to protect property and overawe the workers.63
Although they contributed to the unrest in some cases, labor union agitators did not cause the "strike fever" of 1869-1873. The union movement was
too young and inexperienced for such a task. For Marxists, moreover, trade
unionism had as yet little appeal; their orientation was toward the disruption
of, not accommodation to, the capitalistic system. The real issue was not who
caused but who would benefit from the strikes. Waldenburg's workers (9,000
of the 10,000 miners in the area), for example, requested leadership from Max
Hirsch and yet struck against his advice. Their main demand was for union
representation. To Hirsch union recognition and collective bargaining meant
abandonment of "employer absolutism" and recognition of "equality of status
[Gleichberechtigung] for employees." Would owners, he asked, permit labor "to
stand next to them" or only "under them?" Employers adamantly refused to
deal with the union; and Hirsch's search for adequate financial support as far
away as England proved fruitless.64 The collapse of the Waldenburg strike had

disastrous consequences for the Hirsch-Dunker unions. At the time the strike
began, the union could already claim 268 affiliated local unions (Ortsvereine)
with about 30,000 members. By the end of 1870 the membership had fallen
(the war also had a depressing influence) to 6,000, recovering in 1874 to 357
locals with 22,000 members. The depression of 1873-1879, which ought to
have promoted union membership, actually reduced the Hirsch-Dunker
unions to 16,500 members (365 local unions).65 Although the movement
grew in later decades, the possibility that it would ever represent the whole
or even the largest segment of German labor was gone.
The failures of 1860-1873 may have been decisive in convincing German
labor that neither the government nor the major political parties could be
expected to protect workers in the economic struggle. Earlier it was shown
that state paternalism, which had once shielded mine workers from excessive
exploitation, ended with the mining law of 1861.66 One of the objectives of
miners in 1860-1873 was to restore the eight-hour shift they had possessed
under the old law. Many workers still clung, with diminishing faith, to the
tradition that the king, ministers, and officials stood above the economic
struggle, ready to intervene in behalf of the weak. But in i860-1873 the government's response was to order out the troops and police and, as will be
shown, prosecute and incarcerate those who claimed to represent politically
the interests of proletarians.67 What Liebknecht said of the Waldenburg strike
can be said of the strike movement of 1869-1873 in general. "The government's attitude is making the workers into democrats; the employers' attitude
is making them into socialists."68

Bismarck's Character
The Rewards of Statesmanship
THE GERMAN nation is sick of principles and doctrines, of literary
The greatness and of theoreticalpower,existence. What it wan
honor, more honor than he can imagine." 1 This prophecy by Julius
Fröbel, written in 1859, was more than fulfilled. From a grateful ruler Bismarck received a steady stream of titles, medals, and gifts. In 1865 he was
awarded the title "count" (Graf) and in 1871 that of "prince" (Fürst) carrying
the predicate "serene highness" (Durchlaucht). The Landwehr officer with but
one year's service in the army was promoted up the ranks to colonel general
of the cavalry (with the rank of field marshal) and made honorary commander
of the Magdeburg Cuirassiers. Other rewards were a hereditary seat in the
Prussian House of Lords and appointment as hereditary grandmaster of the
Pomeranian hunt. Naturally he received all the medals and decorations the
Kaiser could bestow, including the successive classes of the Iron Cross, Red
Eagle, and Black Eagle and climaxed by the treasured Pour le Merite, ordinarily granted only for exceptional valor in combat.
The generosity of the monarch was matched by that of the public. Honorary degrees came from faculties of the universities of Halle, Gottingen, Erlangen, Tubingen, Giessen, and Jena; honorary citizenships from Berlin,
Hamburg, Lübeck, Bremen, Stuttgart, Dortmund, Essen, Dresden, and dozens of other cities. His name was to be found throughout the land: on streets,
squares, plazas, buildings, bridges, tunnels, obelisks, towers, ships, fortifications, a town (formerly Braubauerschaft), a mountain peak, an iron foundry,
a dye (dark brown), a vodka, a rose, a jelly doughnut, and a pickled herring.
In the far Pacific a sea, a mountain, and an archipelago received his name; in
southeast Africa, a mountain and a palm tree (Bismarckia nobilis); on the Dakota plains, a city (founded by a railway company eager to attract German
investors). Painters, sculptors, and photographers competed to reproduce his
image. His birthdays brought a flood of telegrams, letters, eulogies, poems,
and personal gifts. Nationwide celebrations were held on his seventieth birthday (1885) and the twenty-fifth anniversary of his appointment as minister
(1887). 2 Not all of his admirers were Germans. On July 4, 1875, he was pre1.

sented with a walking stick carved out of a beam from which had once hung
the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia.3
The recipient of these many honors was not always pleased. During his
years in the diplomatic service he had grown contemptuous of statesmen who
coveted titles, ribbons, medals, and other such "Byzantine" pomp and circumstances. "What is the good of that to me?" he snapped on being told of
his promotion to lieutenant general on January 18, 1871 (the day of the Kaiser proclamation at Versailles and of one of his most bitter conflicts with WiIhelm I). He had enough "gewgaws," he said, on receiving the first class of the
Iron Cross; he felt ashamed to wear it as long as so many who had been in
combat, like his own sons, went unrewarded.4 Neither Bismarck nor his wife
was flattered by their elevation to the dignity of count and countess. As scions
of two of the oldest aristocratic families in the Altmark and Pomerania, they
had no need of an additional title. "It was contrary to my desires," Bismarck
complained in 1876, "that his majesty made me a prince. Earlier I was a rich
count, now I am a poor prince." After 1890 he refused to use the title "Duke
of Lauenburg" awarded to him on retirement by Wilhelm II.5
The gifts he did appreciate were material. In 1867 he received 400,000
thalers from Wilhelm with which to purchase the entailed estate at Varzin in
Pomerania. In 1871 Wilhelm presented to him the Sachsenwald in the duchy
of Lauenburg, a huge domain valued at 1,000,000 thalers (3,000,000 marks).
From the association of German Railways he received in 1871 a private raildes ersten Reichskanzlers (2 vols., Leipzig, 1891—1892); Anhang zu den Gedanken und Ermnerungen
von Otto Fiirst von Bismarck (2 vols., Stuttgart, 1901); and Bismarck-Jahrbuch (6 vols., Leipzig,
1894-1899). See also numerous letters in GW, XIV (part two) and the works edited by Heinrich
von Poschinger: BP and Bismarck-Porte/euilfe (5 vols., Stuttgart, 1889-1900). In 1903 someone
listed 165 German memorials to Bismarck (statues, columns, towers, etc.) and did not claim to
have found them all. The memorials to Bismarck exceeded by far those to Kaiser Wilhelm I,
particularly in Bavaria and Catholic Germany. Thomas Nipperdey, "NationaUdee und Nationaldenkmal in Deutschland im 19. Jahrhundert," Htstonscfie Zeitschri/t, 206 (1968), pp. 577-582.

way car emblazoned (to his distress) with the princely coat of arms.6 To honor
his seventieth birthday a committee, headed by the Duke of Ratibor, president of the Prussian House of Lords, raised a princely sum in excess of
2,300,000 marks. The appeal for contributions was dubbed "Otto pence" (an
allusion to the pope's "Peter's pence") and its unspecified purpose was presumed to be charity. To the surprise of some contributors, a majority on the
committee then voted to commit 1,150,000 marks of the sum (fortified by an
additional 350,000 marks raised from German bankers) for the purchase of
Schonhausen II, an estate that the Bismarck family had been forced to sell
early in the century. Bismarck appears to have accepted this decision without
compunction. With the remaining half of the fund, he established the
"Schonhausen Foundation," devoted to the support of needy students in
training to become teachers in the nation's higher schools and widows and
orphans of deceased teachers in those institutions. But he also arranged privately with Bleichroder to devote a small part of the trust to poor relief at
Schonhausen, where the foundation was to be situated, and to invest some of
the capital in mortgages with which to refinance debts on his estates.7
While he appreciated its political value, Bismarck did not deliberately cultivate personal popularity while he was in office. (We shall see that this was
less true of his retirement years.) "He bore nothing more easily than the feeling of being the most hated man in Germany during the constitutional conflict," wrote Christoph von Tiedemann, by no means a Bismarck idolater.
"That after the Austrian war the waves of enthusiasm in public opinion raised
him high above his fellow men also left him cold. He cared nothing for popularity."8 A grand seigneur of the old tradition, he regarded himself not as a
public servant, but as a "vassal" (Lehnsmann) of the king or, at most, servant
of the state. He disliked political huckstering and contact with crowds. During nearly three decades as minister-president and chancellor he gave almost
no public speeches outside parliament, preferring to manipulate public opinion through the newspaper press. By the late 1860s artists, cartoonists, and
photographers had made his image familiar to millions, and he could not appear in public without attracting attention. He regretted the loss of anonymity, complaining to Lucius about spontaneous ovations to which he was compelled to respond with smiling face on his travels. At his favorite spa, Bad
Kissingen in Bavaria, he felt like a "fossil" on display. "I have ceased to be an
individual," he once remarked. "Whenever I appear, they stare at me as
though I were an event. No sooner do I step into the street than I hear behind
me clattering footsteps of hundreds of people who pursue me."9

* Bismarck's Character *

As the years advanced this distaste for contact with the public grew. In
Berlin he nearly ceased in the 1880s to attend social functions outside his own
home, including those at court. His contacts with the king and crown prince
were limited to private audiences and exchanges of messages.IO Yet he maintained that his door was open to any minister or deputy who wished to speak
with him. While parliament was in session, he held weekly dinners and soirees (later changed to luncheons) at which he was a genial host. He disliked
cities and retreated for months to his estates at Varzin and Friedrichsruh. How
much healthier he would have been, he was fond of saying, if only he had
remained a rural Junker. He regarded Berlin as ugly and unhealthy, maintaining that every house had a bad smell and that shortly "the place would become
utterly intolerable. . . . I have always longed to get away from large cities and
the stink of civilization." On long rides and walks through the woods and
meadows of his estates he renewed his contact with nature and reflected on
the policies he was to pursue. "I have always made my most important decisions," he told a physician, Eduard Cohen, "alone, in the forest."11

Bismarck's Taste
Bismarck's dislike of pomp and circumstance was also evident in his various
dwellings. In 1862 he moved into the narrow two-story building at Wilhelmstrasse 76 that housed the Foreign Ministry. Constructed at the beginning of
the eighteenth century as a private home, it was, inside and out, the "least
pretentious building in the Wilhelmstrasse." Bismarck often made fun of its
plainness, but instigated no changes. On the first floor were the offices and
cubicles of the counselors and clerks of the foreign office, and on the second
were the minister's office, reception rooms, and private quarters of the Bismarck family. In the rear was an extensive private garden shaded by old trees,
where the chancellor frequently walked. Visitors were astonished at the simplicity of their reception. No portier in dress uniform with "Cerberus demeanor" guarded the portals. "One must ring just as one does at the homes of
ordinary mortals." In the antechamber were no lackeys in gold and silver livery of the kind favored by diplomats and ministers. Bismarck received his
visitors in a plain, sparsely furnished office of medium size dominated by a
large mahogany desk. "No provincial prefect in France would have been satisfied with such modest surroundings." In 1878 the Bismarcks moved into the
adjacent Palais Radziwill at Wilhelmstrasse 77, a somewhat grander residence. Purchased by the government in 1874 at a cost of 2,000,000 thalers,
the Radziwill mansion contained stately rooms and salons more suitable for
official entertainment than No. 76, which was retained for office space. To

the Baroness von Spitzemberg the new quarters, redecorated and refurnished
by the Bismarcks, looked expensive, but "right ordinary and often tasteless."12
The impression created by Bismarck's country homes was similar to that of
Wilhelmstrasse 76. "Internally as well as externally, there is no pretension,
no love of luxury about the residence of the chancellor and his family," Moritz
Busch wrote of Varzin, "though it is at the same time pleasant and comfortable throughout. It is the house of a prosperous country gentleman rather than
the chateau of a prince. Almost all floors, it is true, are inlaid, but the ceilings
of the smaller rooms are simply whitewashed. There are no luxurious carpets,
draperies, artistic carvings, or clocks of great value." The residence at Friedrichsruh was even less impressive. Originally an inn frequented by vacationing burghers from Hamburg, it was purchased in 1879 and converted into a
home by Bismarck after he received the surrounding Sachsenwald. To this
"simple building of bourgeois appearance" constructed in the Swiss cottage
style generally favored for railway stations he added two large wings in 1883.
The result was "a large irregular structure without style, but roomy and well
furnished." Close by was a railway station on the main line to Berlin, at which
the citizens of nearby Hamburg debouched for weekend Spaziergdnge, hopeful
of getting a glimpse of the famous resident. For privacy Bismarck was compelled to construct a high brick wall along the railway and intersecting road.
Day and night the trains puffed by the chancellor's dwelling and the whistling
and rattling of the locomotives disturbed the quiet of the compound. It was a
commodious, but not stately, mansion of the kind expected of a man of Bismarck's wealth and status. ' 3
To Count Philipp zu Eulenburg the Schloss at Friedrichsruh revealed something important about its owner and his family—the Bismarcks lacked sense
of beauty or GemUtlichkeit. "The complete tastelessness of the exterior is even
exceeded by the room furnishings inside. The extraordinarily large upholstered furniture is covered with bright cretonne. Some interesting old family
pictures in gold frames, many photographs in black frames, watercolors, fancy
clocks, and strange allegorical pictures—the gifts of enthusiastic Americans—
stand out, garish and ugly on walls papered in white. The carpets laid in all
rooms have shrieking colors, like the bright yellow cretonne [of the furniture]
on which are printed brightflowersand Arabesques. I have never seen American country homes, but perhaps Friedrichsruh makes an impression similar
to them. It bears the stamp of utility with an inclination toward comfort, but
it defies every taste."'4 Eulenburg's vision was somewhat jaundiced, but even

* The Reich of Iron and Blood *

the Baroness von Spitzemberg, an intimate friend of the Bismarcks and their
frequent guest, spoke of Bismarck's "lack of a sense of beauty in itself and in
his surroundings."15 His dwellings became cluttered with art objects, most of
which were busts and portraits of ancestors, members of the family, kings of
Prussia, foreign statesmen (including photographs of Ulysses S. Grant and
George Bancroft), and historical paintings such as Anton Werner's depictions
of the Kaiser proclamation at Versailles and of the Congress of Vienna (both
gifts of the Kaiser). After listening to Bismarck describe his only visit to Italy
(1847), an Italian visitor remarked, "The artistic side of our country appears
to have made no impression on him."' 6 Only once did Bismarck come near
the principal art gallery in Berlin, stopping at the entrance to get out of the
rain. German scholars and writers, nurtured on the concept of the Kulturstaat,
were distressed that the founder and chancellor of the German Reich did
nothing to promote the arts and sciences.I?
Yet Bismarck was not uncultured in other respects. His letters and dispatches show that he was a master of the German language. His literary talent
would have enabled him, if circumstances had required it, to become a highly
effective journalist and feuilletonist. Many of his letters to family and friends
are masterpieces of epistolary art—alternately witty, tender, ironic, pungent,
reflecting his quickly shifting moods. Throughout his career he fought against
the malaise that affects every bureaucracy—the tendency toward official jargon, pomposity of phrase, contradiction in content. His state papers are notable for their clear, unadorned style; often lengthy, they are seldom verbose.
He avoided Fremduiorter and insisted on German in preference to Latin
script.l8
His native literary talent was nurtured by constant reading. The Baroness
von Spitzemberg usually found on his desk a work by Schiller, a volume of
lyric poetry, or a light novel (Schmoker) that he read for relaxation. His parliamentary speeches, which were extemporaneous in execution, contain frequent quotations, usually from Goethe, Schiller, and Shakespeare, but occasionally from Gellert, Scheffel, Uhland, Friedrich Kind, Horace, and Thomas
Moore. The baroness reported that he acquired the works of Chamisso, Uhland, Heine, and Ruckert for each of his residences. "When I get very exasperated and exhausted, I read preferably these German lyricists; that revives
me." Among the classic authors Schiller remained his favorite "as a person's GW, VIII, 598.

ality." "He regards Goethe," Cohen reported, "to be a genuine bureaucrat,
prouder of his ministerial dignity than of his poetic talent." He knew Faust,
Part I, intimately; Part II he considered "incomprehensible and therefore
unenjoyable."19 On occasion his guests were surprised at how well read Bis­
marck appeared to be in contemporary belles-lettres. One evening during the
war against France he discussed with his dinner companions Friedrich von
Spielhagen's Probkmatische Naturen, Gustav Freytag's Soil und Haben, and
Fritz Reuter's Ut de Franzosentid und Ut mine Stromtid. House guests in 1880
found him acquainted with feuilletonist Paul Lindau's monthly Nord und Siid
and the recently published memoirs of Louis Schneider, reader to Friedrich
Wilhelm IV and Wilhelm I, and of Karoline Bauer, a leading actress. He also
read foreign authors. George Eliot, he admired, having read Adam Beds, but
he did not care for Victor Hugo. Turgenev, he remarked in 1882, was "the
most gifted of all living authors." 20
During the imperial age Berlin became one of the great centers for the
performing arts. But Bismarck was not seen in its theaters, concert halls, and
opera houses. Dislike of public attention was not the only reason. The neces­
sity of paying for a ticket and being confined to a seat, he said, robbed him of
all enjoyment—"music should be given as freely as love." At home he listened
to piano and vocal music (Mozart, Schubert, Lowe) performed by his wife and
Robert von Keudell. But Johanna's duties as mother and housewife gave her
less time to play, and, after Keudell left Bismarck's service in 1872, the oc­
casional musicales in the Bismarck household ceased. Bismarck complained
that the melodies echoed in his head for hours and robbed him of sleep.
Richard Wagner he found distasteful both as a composer and as a person (they
met once at a dinner) and for an interesting reason: "Wagner demanded ad­
miration all the time. He always wanted to be number one, but I was too busy
for that." 2 1
Philosophy still left Bismarck cold. Schopenhauer was the philosopher
most in vogue during the second half of the century, and naturally the new
school of philosophic pessimism came up for discussion in the Bismarck
household. The prince listened, puffing on his pipe, but was not inspired to
read. When asked whether he had met Schopenhauer during their mutual

years in Frankfurt am Main, he replied (1884), "He had no need of me, nor I
of him. I have never had time or cause to concern myself with philosophy.
When I was at the university, Schopenhauer was not yet known. I know
nothing of his system." After the concept of the primacy of will over intellect
had been explained to him, he replied, "That may be right. At least I have
often noticed that my will had decided before my thoughts were finished."22
The most significant developments in German intellectual life during the
middle decades of the century were in the fields of historical writing and scientific theory rather than in literature and philosophy. Bent on diversion
rather than information, the chancellor appears to have read less history than
in earlier years. In a discussion of French literature in 1884 (in which he spoke
of an early interest in the romantic poet Pierre de Beranger), he judged that
Hippolyte Taine was superior to "the majority of recent German historians. . . . There are two sorts of historians: one kind makes the waters of the
past clear so that one can see to the bottom; the other makes the water
muddy. To the first belongs Taine, to the second [Heinrich von] Sybel."23
How much he read of Ranke is difficult to determine, but he possessed and
evidently read parts of Die romischen Pdpste (seventh edition, published in
1878), Die englische Geschichte, and Die Weltgeschichte ("Der alte Ranke ist doch
ein Esel"). The two men knew each other for more than forty years, and on
Ranke's death in 1886 Bismarck wrote of him with affection and respect (nurtured by the coincidence of their political views).24 Heinrich von Treitschke
he valued as a publicist and staunch supporter of his policies after 1866, but
ultimately as a historian as well. Of the five volumes of Treitschke's Geschichte
Deutschhnds im neunzehnten Jahrhundert, he found the last covering the period
1840-1848, to be "masterfully written." Bismarck even found some time for
the Romische Geschichte of Theodor Mommsen, the only major German
scholar to oppose him openly after 1871. In 1880 he read at least some of
Johannes Janssen's Geschichte des deutschen Volkes seit dem Ausgang des Mittelalters. "It is quite interesting to read about the age of the Reformation as
described by an opponent of it. Furthermore, the work is very well written.
Naturally Luther appears here in a very different light." No more than in
earlier years did he read systematically; he leafed the pages until some passage
caught his attention, moving on when his interest lagged.25
The widespread popular interest in scientific theory characteristic of the
second half of the century seems to have affected Bismarck minimally. Busch
chanced to record in 1888 that Darwin was held in "high esteem by the

chief," but it is not clear whether Bismarck read any of the works of Darwin
or of Darwin's numerous popularizers. More than likely he merely heard the
theory of evolution discussed. Certainly Darwin's influence may be seen in
Bismarck's theorizing about the value and inevitability of struggle among the
species. If he read Ludwig Buchner's Kraft una Stoff, the popular work from
which the reading public gained its knowledge of the new developments in
physics, he never wrote or (so far as the record shows) spoke of it. Nor did
the technological developments of the century seem to interest him greatly,
although he did consent to demonstrations of the telephone at Varzin in 1877
and Edison's phonograph ("a very clever instrument") at Friedrichsruh in
1889.27 Th e growth of science and technology and their application in the
industrial revolution were rapidly transforming Bismarck's world, but his intellectual interests remained largely those of an educated aristocrat of the old
regime.

Appearance and Manner
In his memoirs Lucius von Ballhausen described Bismarck as he appeared in
the Prussian Chamber of Deputies in 1863 at the height of the constitutional
conflict. "At that time he still wore civilian dress; his bushy mustache was
still red-blonde like his hair, which he still had, although it was even then
sparse. His tall, broad-shouldered figure at the ministers' bench appeared powerful and impressive. There was something provocative about the nonchalance of his bearing, gestures, and way of speaking. He held his right hand in
the pocket of his brightly colored trousers, and his manner reminded me
strongly of the 'crowing seconds' at Heidelberg student duels. In speaking he
already at that time appeared to search for words in long drawn-out sentences
and always found the most effective ones, giving quick, striking responses.
The impression he made on me was Junker-like, yet highly forceful, like an
old corps student—particularly the way in which, with seeming good humor,
he pumped malice into his agitated opponents." As the years advanced, the
hairline receded to an outer gray-white fringe; the mustache gave way for a
time in the early 1880s to a luxuriant full beard. His carriage remained erect
and his gait military, despite increasing age and weight; nor did time change
the irregular speech pattern, the rapier-like stroke, the mixture of humor and
acerbity, the arrogance and condescension.28
After attaining the rank of major general in 1866 Bismarck always wore the
white uniform of the cuirassiers while in Berlin—not always correctly to

Moltke's amusement. He valued the promotion, so he told Tiedemann, because the closed neck of the general's uniform freed him from the daily struggle with starched collars; to Keudell he explained that the high collar protected his throat and prevented colds. But the garment had other uses.
Wilhelm was a soldier at heart, and Bismarck liked to stress that he was just
a royal officer doing his duty in the service of the king.29 The uniform, moreover, projected a more formidable image before his colleagues and parliamentary deputies. At any rate Bismarck did not wear it at Varzin, Friedrichsruh,
Bad Kissingen, or Bad Gastein. There his customary attire was a long black
coat, white neckerchief, and an enormous wide-brimmed felt hat. His forester
at Friedrichsruh described him as he appeared in the woods one day in November 1883: "Slick raincoat, high boots, hunting cap with large bill, spectacles, officer's white gloves, long cane, accompanied by his dog Tyras—picturesque!" Only once, according to Tiedemann, did he ever attempt to wear
formal civilian attire—with grotesque results: double breasted morning coat,
"antediluvian" stand-up collar (popularly known as Vatermorder), and an
enormous cylinder hat. His wife was dismayed.30
Those who saw Bismarck never forgot the massive head with its arched
forehead and energetic chin, bushy eyebrows, drooping mustache, and large
protruding eyes. Undoubtedly the eyes were his dominant feature. They mirrored his swiftly changing moods, alternately stern and forbidding, smiling
and lively. Visitors meeting him for the first time were impressed by his courtesy and congeniality, but felt uncomfortable under the searching gaze. "The
prince surveyed me with a glance that seemed to bore right through my head,"
was a typical reaction. The smile that played on his lips was genial, yet easily
transformed by a slight shift of the mouth into one of devastating irony.31
When well, his physique and manner exuded vigor, strength, and self-confidence. The effect of his bulldog appearance was heightened by the mastiffs
(Sultan and Flora, later Tyras and Rebecca) that accompanied him on his
walks in the country and stood guard at his office in the Wilhelmstrasse. On
occasion Tyras, who was particularly savage, terrified servants, visitors (Gorchakov!), and even Johanna.32

shortsightedness. He did not wear spectacles in public (at most a lorgnette) and was never photographed or painted wearing them. "In Friedrichsruh," he quipped, "I always wear spectacles,
for everything I see interests me; in Berlin, I never wear them because nothing there interests
me." GW, VIII, 449. For the lorgnette see BP, I, 141.

44

* The Reich of Iron and Blood *

Bismarck's portraits and photographs were many, and the line-drawings derived either from them or from life and published in scores of newspapers and
magazines made his image well known to millions. His image stared from the
walls of innumerable homes, along with those of the Kaiser and Moltke (not
only in Germany, but also as far off as the author's ancestral home in Tennessee). In those depictions the public saw the same massive head and piercing
eyes that impressed his visitors but none of the humor and geniality they reported. The expression frozen by camera and brush is invariably unsmiling,
forceful, and autocratic—the blood and iron Bismarck. "There is no good
picture of me," Bismarck once complained. "Actually I have a dreamy, sentimental nature."33 But what the pictures portray is what the photographers
and artists saw. If dreamy and sentimental, he did not project it.
Most of Bismarck's guests found him a fascinating conversationalist. "If the
point does not lie in the words, it lies in the tone. That one has to hear and
to have heard. What he says is full of shadings, colors, allusions, innuendoes,
and refinements that one cannot recapitulate. The voice, demeanor, wellcalculated pauses—all have the effect of giving emphasis to the thought he
wishes to express. One moment he strikes a jolly tone, the next moment he
becomes serious or acts so at least."34 This description by an Italian who visited Bismarck only once is matched by one from Baroness von Spitzemberg
who saw him often. "I only wish I could write down what all my forceful friend
revealed in all kinds of little remarks, jokes, and sudden insights—momentarily very serious, even melancholic, then harsh and vital, then mild again,
amiable, wise, and tolerant of mankind's weaknesses, if not of men themselves. The apparent contradictions in this powerful personality have an intense magic that always captivates anew."35 On social occasions Bismarck
loved to relate details about his experiences at crucial moments in his career,
such as the revolution of 1848, his clashes with the Austrian envoys at Frankfurt, his interview with Wilhelm at the time of his appointment in 1862, the
military and diplomatic campaigns of 1866 and 1870-1871. Strangers were
often astonished at how casually he seemed to speak about seemingly sensitive
political matters, particularly about his relationship to the king and royal family. Many guests found him a "jovial" and considerate host full of entertaining
Bismarck, one that seems to have affected him more deeply than any other personal loss of his
adult life. Tiedemann, Sechs ]ahre, pp. 211-212. When Tyras died in 1889, Bismarck did not
have the heart to tell his wife, leading her to believe that the animal was in the care of a veterinary hospital. GW, XIV, 992-994. To Bismarck's distress Wilhelm II presented him with a woeful substitute for Tyras: "a caricature of a dog, with a huge head, watery eyes, lean body, small
chest, completely without pedigree, not at all comparable to the elegant Rebecca." But Bismarck
resisted the temptation to have the animal put away; "he is so fond of me and has such good,
faithful eyes." Dec. 5, 1889. Spitzemberg, Tagebuch, p. 265.

stories. Some were less entranced, noting that he tended to turn the conversation into a monologue and that his stories usually centered on his own
achievements and the follies of others.36
In writing his memoirs, Christoph von Tiedemann also found it difficult to
describe the very complicated character of the man with whom he was closely
associated for six years. "He was certainly a man poured from a single mold
and yet the most astonishing contradictions fought each other in him." Even
the sycophantic Moritz Busch was compelled to admit that at times, when
looking back on his achievements, Bismarck seemed to feel like "God the
father on the seventh day. . . . But he also has softer moments—moments of
apparent dissatisfaction with his achievements and his fate." One such moment came on a Sunday in October 1877 when he reflected, "But for me three
great wars would not have taken place, eighty thousand men would not have
been killed and would not now be mourned by parents, brothers, sisters, and
widows." "Faust complains about having two souls in his breast," Bismarck
once said to Keudell, "but I harbor a whole crowd of them, and they quarrel.
It is like being in a republic. . . . I tell most of what they say, but there are
whole provinces into which I will never let another person look."37

Subordinates and Colleagues
No more than the artists and photographers did Bismarck's subordinates see
much of the sentimental side he claimed for himself. "All of us had the impression when he took office," wrote Immanuel Hegel, "that he regarded us
with mistrustful eyes, speculating whether we had been bought or were otherwise under someone else's influence. Once he became convinced that we
who worked in the cabinet's secretariat were all honest people and good Prussians, we enjoyed his confidence. Still, we were all just instruments for his
will; there was no room for a pleasant relationship." When Robert von Keudell, a personal friend, entered Bismarck's service in 1863, Johanna warned
him that he must learn to distinguish between minister and friend. "They are
two quite different people." Count Friedrich zu Eulenburg, Prussian minister
of interior, admonished Keudell, "Your position with Bismarck will be very
difficult; you can be sure of that. He is a forceful man and suffers no contra36
For two examples of his candor with strangers see: GW, VII, 232-237 (interview with Karl
Schurz), and Lucius, Bismarck-Ennnerungen, pp. 7-9. After a parliamentary dinner, Jan. 26,
1873, Ludwig Bamberger wrote in his diary: "Although he had delivered two long speeches in
the Landtag, he talked from 5:15 until 8:30 P.M. without pause. He listens only to himself and
will not be diverted from the thread of the thoughts he spins out. He weaves into his fabric
whatever suits him and lets the rest fall to the floor." Bamberger, Bismarcks grosses Spiel, p. 298.

diction. He reduces those who have anything to do with him to obedience—
resist him however much one will." "I was at that time forty years old," Keudell wrote, "and had long been accustomed to draft official documents with
hardly any corrections by my superiors; but now I was reduced again to the
position of a pupil whose drafts seldom remained unchanged." "Whenever I
entered to deliver an oral report," related Immanuel Hegel, "I gathered all of
my wits firmly together, in order to be equal to anything unexpected. A relaxed, self-satisfied air was not appropriate with him, for one was in that case
in danger of being bypassed or run over."38
Bismarck's subordinates soon learned that he would accept neither advice
nor criticism—only information. "He always strove to learn, readily accepted
factual information, and remained open to the daily impressions gained from
commerce with others, from business, and from the press; but, if anyone
sought to give him advice, he was critical or negative." Friedrich Eulenburg
advised Tiedemann never to voice an immediate objection, even when aware
that an instruction could not be carried out; otherwise Bismarck would find
"crushing reasons" for his position and "no power on earth" would be able to
move him. Only later, when the counselor could claim to have made an attempt, would Bismarck listen to and possibly accept the objection.39 Seldom
was there a word of commendation, even after an assistant had worked
through the night and executed a difficult task. Minor transgressions produced terrifying outbursts of anger, particularly in periods of political tension
or ill health. "I am still not clear," wrote Philipp Eulenburg, "how the same
person could sometimes hold himself so masterfully in check and yet become
at other times on scant provocation so unrestrained." Others had the impression that Bismarck, when angry, never really lost his self-control. "It's useful
for the entire mechanism if I get angry at times," he said. "It puts stronger
steam into the engine."40
Men of independent mind found it difficult or impossible to submit to the
kind of self-effacement Bismarck demanded of assistants. Kurd von Schlozer,
whose brilliance Bismarck finally appreciated during their association in St.
Petersburg, refused his overtures in 1862, preferring minor foreign posts to a
subaltern status at Wilhelmstrasse 76 ("I can't sell myself, hide and hair. I am
not the type to be a slave."). Hermann von Thile, who became Bismarck's
principal subordinate in the Foreign Office, found his situation increasingly
difficult. A conservative diplomat of the old school, he objected to the "im38

no suspicion of personal animus was possible, Bismarck was capable of surprising restraint. In
1867 Keudell accidentally closed a train door on Bismarck's finger, causing a bloody and painful
wound. The chancellor did not utter an unfriendly word. Keudell, Bismarck, pp. 378-379.

47

morality" of his chief's policy in 1866. The minister listened quietly and then
"came on like a lion," bitterly reproaching Thile for apostasy. In 1872 Thile
again incurred Bismarck's wrath by opposing the Kulturkampf and the chancellor found an opportunity to force his resignation. Although Thile lived
until 1889, Bismarck never saw him again and at his death gave no sign of
caring. "Never regret and never forgive," was the motto he seemed to live by.
Even his most assiduous amanuensis, Heinrich Abeken, to whom Bismarck
was the "instrument of God," admitted that his chief was "sometimes very
difficult to get on with." After serving Bismarck for six years, Tiedemann
resigned fearing loss of self-identity. When Hohenlohe entered the foreign
service as ambassador to Paris, Bleichroder warned him that the chancellor
"has no consideration and squeezes people like lemons."41 One could "live
with this powerful personality," another observer concluded, "only by becoming either his opponent or his tool."42
Yet his subordinates felt the "demonic attraction" of the man and believed
they were working for a genius. To Tiedemann Bismarck's various powers
seemed uniquely "balanced" and "harmonious"—"capacity for comprehension, ability to make combinations, memory and decisiveness." "He arrived
with wonderful sureness at the heart of the matter, however complicated and
involved the problem. At first glance he knew how to distinguish between
what was essential and what was unessential. . . . As soon as a presentation
had been made, he gave his answer without pausing a moment to collect his
thoughts. Never have I seen him uncertain in making a decision; he knew
immediately what he wanted."43 Basic decisions on policy, in contrast to the
routine transaction of business, were not always reached with such rapidity.
Behind the swift dictations that the chancellor gave to Bucher, Tiedemann,
Abeken, and others often lay hours of reflection and ripening decision.
Bismarck's colleagues in the Prussian cabinet also suffered from his vulcanic
temperament. Under the Prussian collegial system cabinet ministers were theoretically not the inferiors, but the peers of the minister-president. His success
in molding the king to his will and his role as chancellor enabled Bismarck to
establish an ascendancy over his colleagues. Yet he continued to fume at the
"unusable old people" whom he inherited as ministers in 1862 and whom he
could not "send away" because Wilhelm liked familiar faces.44 They resisted

his attempts to interfere in the affairs of their ministries and on occasion still
opposed him on matters of policy in cabinet meetings. Bismarck rejoiced to
see them go, one by one, often through his own conniving: Bodelschwingh
in 1866, Lippe in 1867, Heydt in 1869, Miihler in 1872, Selchow and Itzenplitz in 1873. There were frictions even in his relationship to Roon, ending
only with the latter's retirement in November 1873. Of the original members
of his cabinet only Friedrich Eulenburg managed to survive until 1878—by
outmaneuvering the chancellor at a critical moment in 1872.
The new ministers and imperial officials—Delbriick, Camphausen, Leonhardt, FaIk, Achenbach, Friedenthal—were amenable to Bismarck's "liberal
course" in domestic affairs before 1875. His change of front during 1876-1880
produced repeated cabinet crises that ended their careers. The tenure of some
of their successors—Hofmann, Hobrecht, Bitter, Stolberg, and Botho Eulenburg—was short. Not until after 1881 was Bismarck's control over the Prussian cabinet secure. In Lucius, Boetticher, Puttkamer, Gossler, Scholz, Maybach, and Friedberg he found ministers both responsive to his will and
sympathetic to his more conservative course.
By his own admission Bismarck's capacity for recognizing the achievements
of colleagues was limited.45 His instinct was to command rather than collaborate; hence he detested the Prussian collegial system that obligated him to
listen to the views of others. "Whenever I want a spoonful of soup, I have to
ask eight asses for permission." At cabinet meetings he was generally polite,
but afterward couldn't resist making fun of the ministers, mocking the protruding lower lip of one and carefully clipped beard of another.46 Ministers
and officials who proved to be effective instruments for the execution of his
policies were given some freedom of action. Delbriick, FaIk, Boetticher, Maybach, and Stephan are cases in point. But when his policy shifted, he expected colleagues and subordinates to follow, regardless of their convictions.
Why Delbriick resigned rather than accept the demolition of much of what
he had worked a decade to achieve Bismarck professed never to understand.
« "I have only a limited capacity to admire other people," Bismarck wrote to Leopold von
Gerlach in 1857. "My shortcoming is that my eye is sharper for weaknesses than strengths." GW,
XIV, 464. In 1870, for example, Bismarck could not bring himself to thank Rudolf Delbriick
personally for the privy counselor's formidable achievements in negotiating with the Reichstag,
Bundesrat, and lesser states for German unification. He avoided the task by asking his wife to
convey his commendation to Delbriick! Ibid., p. 800. In later years he did manage to write letters
thanking ministers Maybach and Boetticher. Ibid., p. 946, and Brauer, Im Dienste Bismarcfes, pp.
191-192. In 1884 Lothar Bucher complained, "I have worked under him now for twenty years,
and he has only once (during the constitutional conflict) told me that something I wrote (a
newspaper article) was good; and yet I believe I have written many better ones." Heinnch von

That he could not extract regressive and protectionist tax bills from a laissezfaire minister of finance like Camphausen irritated and angered him.47
Bismarck developed the technique of easing or ejecting a minister from
office into a fine art; harsh criticisms in personal letters, attacks in the public
press, open disavowals in parliament, and even the threat of his own resignation. Not every tree fell immediately to his axe. Officials with good connections at court were hard to dispose of. Despite the chancellor's dissatisfaction, Albrecht von Stosch survived as chief of the admiralty from 1872 to
1883. To be rid of Harry von Arnim, German ambassador to France, Bismarck had to go to extraordinary lengths, eventually hounding him into exile
to avoid prison. In the foreign service Bismarck was even less prone to accept
opposition or contrary advice than in other branches of the government.
"Like soldiers," he said, "my ambassadors must wheel and turn on command."48 "I have lived through difficult times," he once complained, "because
I have had no one with whom I could consult."49 But clearly this was a circumstance of Bismarck's own making.
"He subjected the accomplishments of his ministerial colleagues to a criticism that often lacked objectivity," wrote Tiedemann. "In the case of greater
political actions, he was accustomed to attribute the successes to himself,
while attributing every failure to the appropriate minister." Nunquam retrorsum was his motto. "His self-esteem was, like that of Frederick the Great and
Napoleon, coupled with a strong dose of cynicism and this led him, not infrequently, to underestimate friends and foes. He saw in friends only tools for
his plans—chessmen whom he could shove this way and that way on the
chessboard of his policies and whom he could sacrifice when the game demanded it. In enemies he saw only rascals and dumbbells. He could only use
friends who completely identified themselves with him. He regarded them
with mistrust the moment they permitted themselves to have a different opinion or to adopt a position contrary to his expectations. I have never found
that he did full justice to an opponent. For that he was too impassioned, too
impetuous, too belligerent. In this respect, as in many others, he was like
Luther. Every attack, even the smallest, aroused him to counterattack, and
he was always ready to repay a needle prick with a sword thrust."50
Not long after escaping Kallmann's bullet at Bad Kissingen in 1874 Bismarck wrote to the Kaiser: "Anger and hatred are bad advisers in politics, and
I pray to God for humility and reconciliation."51 This was an observation he

often made, and the religious sentiment was undoubtedly genuine. Yet he had
difficulty following his own advice. "It is a notable aspect of Bismarck's char­
acter," wrote Lucius von Ballhausen, "that he harbors so intensively thoughts
of revenge or retribution for injustices he has suffered or believes he has suf­
fered. In his sickly excitability he perceives much as unjust that the other
party does not so intend at all." 52 Once on listening to a stanza from Goethe
Selig wer sich νστ der Welt
Ohne Hass verschliesst,
Einen Freund am Busen halt
una mit dem geniesst.
he exclaimed, "What! Without hatred? What a tailor's soul he must have!" 5 3
Bismarck's Health
One of the causes of the chancellor's choler was persistent bad health. During
the constitutional conflict and the Danish War he fluctuated between periods
of intense activity, when his energies seemed inexhaustible, and periods of
near incapacitation, when he complained of headaches, neuralgia, and dis­
comfort in his left leg. Keudell, his secretary in this period, was "never with­
out concern about his health." 54 After 1865 the intervals of ill health in­
creased in frequency and duration, reaching a climax in 1882-1883. He often
doubted whether he would be able to continue in office and repeatedly ten­
dered his resignation on grounds of ill health coupled with political discon­
tent. His afflictions did compel him to surrender the office of Prussian minis­
ter-president in 1872-1873 and to contemplate the same step in 1884.
Two of his physical problems stemmed from injuries. Always an indifferent
horseman—observers noted that he did not conform to the movements of the
horse—he was in his early years a reckless one. Three of the many falls he
55
experienced resulted in bad concussions, and one in 1868 broke three ribs.
Only one of these accidents left a lasting injury, caused more by medical mal­
treatment than by the fall itself. While hunting in Sweden in 1857, he suf­
fered a fall that left him with a painful leg. As noted earlier, the mustard
plaster applied by an incompetent doctor at St. Petersburg in 1859 destroyed
a vein and nearly cost him the leg itself. In the following year complica­
56
tions—thrombosis, embolism, and pneumonia—endangered his life. Peri­
odically thereafter he suffered an inflammation and swelling in the left leg and
foot that forced him to walk with a cane or confined him to bed and sofa. In

1874 a would-be assassin shot him in the right hand, leaving it numb and
weak. After that he was compelled to dictate many personal letters that he
would have preferred to write by hand.57
In addition, Bismarck was afflicted increasingly by attacks of neuralgia,
rheumatism, and gout (bringing severe pains to his hip, face, and leg), and
by migraine headaches, varicose veins, and bouts of grippe, jaundice, shingles, and hemorrhoids. His most persistent ailments, other than the bad leg,
were digestive disorders accompanied by severe stomachaches, cramps, and
vomiting. Another frequent curse in later years was facial neuralgia (tic douloureux or trigeminal neuralgia), a piercing pain that came and went at intervals and for which there was no lasting remedy. During the 1870s Bismarck
was often afraid of a stroke and in 1880 he believed that he had actually
suffered one. We shall see that in 1882-1883 both he and his doctors believed
that he had but a few months to live.58
While Bismarck had real physical ailments, it is apparent that his health
problem was also psychological. His collected works, particularly his recorded
conversations, are so studded with complaints about the state of his health as
to suggest hypochondria. People who were often in his company during the
1870s and 1880s confirm it. "He was very sensitive to bodily pain and discomfort," reads one account, "from which he suffered severely, even to the point
of tears. He complained a lot, at times in an exaggerated way. At such times
he had a need for sympathy and loving treatment from those around him and
grew bitter if he did not receive that in sufficient measure. Often he let himself be diverted by friendly words, jokes, and expressions of sympathy; then
he forgot about his complaints. He had a very peculiar attitude toward medicine and doctors. He was very conscious of everything that affected his body,
had himself regularly weighed and measured, always had a house physician
who visited him every day and for a long period actually had to put him to
bed. He had a lively interest in medicines and, if anyone had a headache,
gladly gave him a powder. His chief ailment was a stubborn sleeplessness that
was treated for a time with opium, later with paraldehyde, also with baths and
wet cloths fWkkeln].""
At a parliamentary soiree in May 1872 Bismarck described to his guests
what happened on a typical sleepless night. "I can't sleep at all, regardless of
what I try. I read then, get out of bed again, walk about in my quarters,
smoke—nothing helps. It is often seven o'clock in the morning before I fall
fast asleep. Then I often sleep until two o'clock in the afternoon. I know that
my nerves are at fault—I left them at Versailles. The shameful part of it is
that, when I can't sleep, I recall all the vexations I have had—and in in57

creased measure—never anything pleasant. I find excellent replies to utterances that have annoyed me. This wakes me up all the more, and I don't
come to a peaceful sleep."60 Among the vexations that kept him awake, he
confessed to Lucius in 1876, was the memory of injustices suffered at the
hands of those rapier-wielding teachers at the Plamann Anstalt who "hated
the sons of noblemen." "Then I get downright hot about that and dream in
my half-sleep about how to defend myself."6'
Hypochondria and insomnia were accompanied by gluttony. Those who
could afford it probably ate more in the nineteenth century than is common
today; yet even contemporaries were astounded by what they observed at the
Bismarck family table. "The first time I dined at the Bismarcks [1875]," wrote
Tiedemann, "he complained about not having any appetite. Then I watched
with growing astonishment as he devoured a three-man serving of every
course. He preferred heavy and indigestible foods, and the princess supported
this inclination. If he suffered from an upset stomach at Varzin or Friedrichsruh, she had nothing more pressing to do than to telegraph the restaurant
Borchardt in Berlin for a shipment of pate de foie gras of the larger size. When
this was presented at table on the following day, the prince would open a large
breach in it with the first stroke. As it was passed around the table he followed
it with jealous glances, the consequence being that everyone present remembered the saying, 'Modesty is a virtue.' " "When the dish came back to him,
its volume only slightly diminished, he devoured all that remained. No wonder that after such culinary excesses gastric disturbances were the order of the
day."62
In 1880 Tiedemann described an average menu at Friedrichsruh. Lunch
consisted of "roast beef or beef steak with potatoes, cold roast venison, fieldfare, fried pudding, etc.," dinner of "six heavy courses plus dessert."63 The
final meal ("tea") came at midnight just before retiring, and obviously had
something to do with the host's insomnia. During the 1850s and 1860s Bismarck was a chain smoker of cigars from morning to night. Early in 1879 he
switched to a pipe, complaining that cigars didn't taste good any more. His
lifetime consumption of cigars, he boasted, was "not more than 100,000,"
and of champagne 10,000 bottles. "During my diplomatic period I not infrequently drank two bottles of champagne at midday."64 Bismarck was proud of
his reputation as a drinker, claiming that in his youth he had been able to

down six bottles of wine without getting drunk or sick. According to one
report, he normally drank wine with every meal (including breakfast—along
with milk and lemon water), beer or sparkling wine during his afternoon ride,
and beer during the evening.65 The Bavarian envoy in Berlin, Count Hugo
von Lerchenfeld-Koefering, recalled in his memoirs an evening when Bismarck, after having consumed "several liters of Bock beer" during a soiree,
invited him to remain after other guests had left to drink alternately Jamaica
rum and champagne, which were topped off at 2:00 A.M. with port. The host
became animated and talkative, but appeared otherwise unaffected.66
What impressed Bismarck's guests alarmed his doctors. At age thirty-two
he weighed 200 pounds (182 Pfund), which, since he was tall (six feet, four
inches) and heavy set, was presumably his normal weight. At sixty-four he
weighed 272 pounds (247 Pfund).61 Naturally his physicians were well aware
that his obesity and consumption of tobacco and alcohol had much to do with
his other health problems. For years Bismarck was attended by a Berlin physician, Heinrich Struck, who feared as early as 1872 that his patient was
headed for a complete breakdown. But Struck was unable to establish any
control over the chancellor's habits, and in 1882 finally gave up in exasperation. While he had constant need for them, Bismarck professed to have little
faith in physicians, their diagnoses, and their prescriptions. They were "dolts"
who "made elephants out of gnats"; the reverse of what they advised was
usually correct. Doctors, on the other hand, found him a poor patient. He
demanded that they restore his health without changing his life-style. One
who treated him in 1856 described him as "hysterical as a woman [Frauen?jmmer]."68

* The Reich of Iron and Blood *

In 1883, however, a young (age 33) Bavarian doctor succeeded where his
predecessors had failed. Ernst Schweninger reduced Bismarck's consumption
of wine and tobacco, insisted on sensible hours and proper exercise, and introduced a low-fat diet chiefly of fish, including herring, of which the patient
became particularly fond. For the next fifteen years he attended Bismarck
almost daily and undoubtedly prolonged his life. Both Struck and Schweninger profited from their relationship with Bismarck. The former was appointed
head of the Reichsgesundheitsamt; the latter, professor of medicine at Berlin—
over the protests of the medical faculty. In addition, Schweninger became a
prominent society doctor, although never highly regarded by the medical profession.69
From the psychoanalytic standpoint Bismarck's relationship to his physicians is revealing. Unable to do without them, he was unwilling to submit his
body to their regulation and control. Why he submitted finally to Schweninger presents a problem. We shall see that Schweninger arrived at a propitious
moment, for in 1883 Bismarck was thought to have cancer and had been
warned that his time was short. Schweninger succeeded because he had an
instinctive feel for the psychological needs of his patient. Years later he confided to a historian what occurred on the crucial evening in June 1883 when
he won the prince's confidence. "Bismarck was on the verge of a physical
collapse. He believed that he had already had a stroke and suffered from severe headaches and complete sleeplessness. No treatment had done him any
good. He mistrusted all doctors. A relative, [he said] had taken his life because of a similar disorder; 'That will also be my fate.' 'Tonight, your highness,' said the doctor, 'you will sleep,' 'We shall wait and see,' Bismarck replied skeptically. Schweninger wrapped him in a damp body roll [Leitwickel]
and gave him some drops of valerian, telling him, however, that it was not a
sleeping potion. Then the doctor sat in the easy chair next to his bed and
took one of Bismarck's hands in his own, 'like a mother with a restless child,'
until the chancellor fell asleep. When he awakened in the morning, the doctor still sat at his side and Bismarck could not believe that it was day and that
home (not unusual, according to Struck) during an attack of jaundice in the spring of 1870.

69
Schweninger had been dismissed from the medical faculty at Munich on a morals charge
("stuprum in a churchyard under blooming lilacs"). On Bismarck's intervention he was "rehabilitated" by the Reich government and appointed to the Berlin medical faculty by the Prussian
Kultusminister Gustav von Gossler. Schweninger's presence in Berlin was regarded as "in the
interest of the Reich" because of his success in treating the chancellor. Lucius, Bismarck-Ennnerungen, p. 301. Schweninger regarded medicine as an art rather than a science and was skeptical
of the results of medical research, which explains his difficulties with professional colleagues. See
his Der Arzt in Martin Buber, ed., Die Gesellschaft: Sammlung sozial-psychohgischer Monographien,
vol. 7 (Frankfurt a. M., 1906). On his professional reputation see Sigmund Freud, The Origins of
Psychoanalysis, Letters to Wuhelm Fliess: Drafts and Notes, 1887-1902 (New York, 1954), p. 245.

* Bismarck's Character *

he had actually slept the entire night. 'From that moment he trusted me.' "7°
Schweninger, it seems, became a surrogate parent. Whatever he lacked as a
physician he made up as a practical psychiatrist who knew instinctively what
the patient required. He resided for long periods in the Bismarck household,
carefully monitoring what the prince ate, drank, and smoked, how he exer­
cised, and when he retired at night. Putting the iron chancellor to bed evi­
dently became a nightly routine. Once when the doctor was away, the prince
remarked at bedtime to his daughter, Marie, "I long very much for Schwen­
inger." While Bismarck often complained of the physician's "tyranny," he
submitted to it. "I treated the other doctors," he joked, "but Schweninger
treated me." 7 1
A Diagnosis
In psychoanalytic theory gluttony, hypochondria, and insomnia have been
regarded as symptoms of a depressed condition stemming from trauma suffered
in early childhood that have been reawakened by some adverse event in the
life of the adult. 72 Earlier it was shown that the most important personalities
in Bismarck's early life—an affable but ineffectual father, a domineering yet
distant and self-absorbed mother, and harsh and unsympathetic teachers—
did not satisfy his emotional needs. To survive psychologically in an unempathic environment he was compelled to rely on his own innate physical and
intellectual gifts. He did not achieve psychological independence gradually—
by first relying on others and then emancipating himself from that depen­
dence, step by step—but by a comparatively short transition. As a conse­
quence, his sense of autonomy was both intense and vulnerable. It required
buttressing both within (through self-control, personal achievement, and
self-esteem) and without (through religious faith, a responsive home environ­
ment, and personal dominance). 73

still practiced by some physicians in Germany. It is believed capable of curing a variety of ail­
ments. Schweninger employed it against insomnia, but its actual function may have been to

Bismarck himself identified one source of the trauma that influenced the
formation of his character. An aide, Friedrich von Holstein, wrote in his diary
in January 1884: "The chief's uncharitable way of judging people and his in­
ability to attach himself to other human beings were partly inherited from his
mother, partly fostered by her. A pleasure-loving woman, she sent him when
he was six or seven to a boarding school, of whose severity he often speaks.
He has brought his wife to such a pitch of bitterness against his mother by
telling these stories that Princess Bismarck often speaks of her with character­
istic lack of restraint." Recently Johanna had remarked, "I hope the worthless
creature is now being suitably tortured for it." An uncomprehending guest
asked, "Whom do you mean, Princess?" "His mother," Johanna responded.
"Whose mother?" "Bismarck's mother." The silence that followed was broken
by the chancellor, "Yes, my pessimism can be traced back to my mother and
the training she gave me as a child." 74 Appropriately this conversation oc­
curred at dinner. Through gluttony the adult Bismarck compensated for the
emotional starvation he experienced as a child.
In contrast to constant complaints about his mother and teachers, Bis­
marck reminisced rarely about the failure of his father to give him a proper
upbringing. Yet we have seen that the father, who was socially inept and
dominated by his wife, did not provide the young Otto with the strong, idealizable image that he required for the solution of his oedipal problem. This
may have been the reason why Bismarck as a young man abandoned his in­
tellectual flirtation with republicanism and identified himself so strongly with
the aristocracy as an estate, despite his often expressed contempt for Prussian
aristocrats as individuals. In the idealized social caste of the Junkers, with its
long tradition of leadership in the army and government and its ethic of ser­
vice and sacrifice, he evidently found the strength and authority that his fa­
ther lacked. This view would explain not only Bismarck's choice of a career
and his compulsiveness in pursuing it, but also the pathology of his adult
conduct.
While his physicians attributed the "bankruptcy" of his nervous system to
overwork, irregular hours, and improper diet, Bismarck himself attributed it
advice of Thomas Kohut and from the works of Heinz Kohut, "Thoughts on Narcissism and
Narcissistic Rage," in The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child, 27 (1972), pp. 360-400, and The
Restoration of the Self (New York, 1977).

to political opposition. The first critical illness of his life, that of 1859-1860,
had physical causes (an injured leg, pneumonia, and rheumatic fever). But its
severity stemmed from years of frustration—the unwillingness of his superiors
in Berlin to adopt the aggressive stance he advocated against Austria, his exile
in St. Petersburg by the new-era government, and the decision of that gov-

58

* The Reich of Iron and Blood *

ernment to seek afiscalreform (liquidation of exemptions from the real estate
tax previously enjoyed by noble estates, including Schonhausen and Kniephof) with which he strongly disagreed. The real cause of his nearly fatal
illness was, in Bismarck's words, "an explosion of all the anger I accumulated
during eight years in Frankfurt." Alexander von Below, his host during that
difficult winter, agreed. The greatest danger to Bismarck's health, he wrote to
Blanckenburg, was his profession. Bismarck had been accustomed for too long
to concentrate his energies on "extreme thoughts and feelings." The cure was
simple: "Love thine enemies!" This was the best "door" through which to
release "the mounting pressures from the darkness of his sick body and the
best medicine against the amazing visions and thoughts [Vorstellungen] that
threaten to draw him into death."75
The foes that aroused in Bismarck this self-destructive anger were domestic
rather than foreign. In the scramble of European politics he expected the
great powers to further their own interests; this was the natural law of the
European political system. Hence in 1866 and 1870 Bismarck rallied to endure the hardship and fatigue of military campaigns. His assistants marveled
at the "well nigh superhuman" working capacity he displayed during the summer and fall of r87o. "C'est h. guerre." he explained. "All at once I have
nerves like wire."76 The relapses suffered after both wars he blamed on conflicts with the king, generals, ministers, and political parties. What injured
Bismarck most, however, was growing opposition from members of his own
social class. Many Junker conservatives openly broke with his government on
the Kulturkampf and other issues in 1872. Their alienation cost Bismarck
many personal friends, Duz-Bruder, with whom he had been on intimate
terms most of his life. They accused him of betraying his social class, of harming its interests and those of the monarchy, of violating the divine order and
falling away from God. To Bismarck it was incomprehensible that conservatives would refuse to support the king's government on any major issue of
policy. To deny support was like desertion on the battlefield; active opposition was treachery. The most savage attacks made upon Bismarck came from
conservatives rather than democrats, socialists, or Catholics. Led by the
Kreuzzeitung itself, they questioned not only his policies, but his ethics and
his honesty.77

In his diary (Apr. 1884) Fnedrich von Holstein recorded Bismarck's own explanation of the
difference between foreign and domestic foes: "In diplomatic affairs I fully recognize people's right
to contradict me and resist my plans. The bear has a right to defend itself against me. It is quite
a different thing if the bear (that is, a foreign power) bites me or if my dog bites me." Rich and

Once before Bismarck had felt deserted and betrayed by conservatives with
whom he had so often "eaten from the same bowl." In i860 he complained
that the conservative press did not defend him against attacks by liberal newspapers. "One ought not to rely on men," he remarked bitterly. "I am thankful
for every impulse that draws me within myself."78 In December 1870 he wrote
to his wife from Versailles, "To be a minister too long and to be successful
with God's help is to feel distinctly the cold tide of disfavor and hate rising
higher and higher right up to the heart. One gains no new friends; the old
ones die or back off in disaffection. Furthermore, the cold descends from
above—that is the natural history of all rulers, even the best. Yet every favorable inclination requires reciprocity if it is to last. In short, I am freezing
emotionally [geistig], and I long for your company and to be with you in the
solitude of the country."79 During the 1870s he withdrew into the circle of his
family, spending many months of the year far from Berlin on distant estates
at Varzin in Pomerania and Friedrichsruh near Hamburg. When in Berlin he
seldom appeared at court, which he believed dominated by enemies, or in
public, except for parliament and for the dinners and soirees at which he
entertained members of parliament. His alienation from members of his own
social caste was compounded by fear of assassination. During the 1870s the
number of groups capable of producing an assassin grew steadily—ultraconservatives, ultramontane Catholics, Poles, socialists, and anarchists. After
Kullmann's attempt on his life in 1874, Bismarck kept a loaded pistol on his
office desk; in public he carried it "or at least a knife" in his pocket. Two
policemen in civilian dress followed him at a discrete distance and patrolled
his quarters at night. 8°
At his own hearth this beleaguered man found the sense of security and
dominance that he no longer felt while among his fellow Junkers and his
countrymen. Johanna von Puttkamer was a plain, pious, somewhat retiring
person who contrasted sharply with other women whom Bismarck courted or
admired. Laura Russell, Isabella Loraine-Smith, Marie von Thadden, and
Katharina Orlov are all described, like his mother, as beautiful and spirited.
(Of Otilie von Puttkamer we have no known description.) Yet his letters to
Johanna before and after marriage in 1847 reveal a genuine emotional attachment; the earliest have the cathartic quality of a rueful sinner confessing the
details of his misspent youth in the expectation of absolution. Three children
were born in fast succession: Herbert in 1848, Wilhelm ("Bill") in 1849, Marie in 1852. He required of his wife what he had missed as a child in his own
home—a maternal figure with warmth, simplicity, and dependence, without
social aspirations or pretensions. At the beginning of his diplomatic career in

1851 he stated his needs eloquently in a letter designed to reassure her about
the new life ahead. "I did not marry you in order to have a society wife for
others, but in order to love you in God and according to the requirements of
my own heart, to have a place in this alien world that no barren wind can
cool, a place warmed by my own fireplace, to which I can draw near while it
storms and freezes outside. And I want to tend my own fire and lay on wood,
blow the flames, and protect it and shelter it against all that is evil and foreign."81
A search in marriage for the kind of nurture provided by a mother is a
common phenomenon. Bismarck's problem was complicated by the unconscious need to replace both the mother that was (educated, libidinally desirable, and socially accomplished), whom he sought in various relationships,
and the mother that was not (warm, loving, protective, with strong maternal
instincts), whom he found in Johanna. One cannot say that he was entirely
satisfied with his choice. This daughter of a Pomeranian Junker family was a
country maiden of limited experience who knew little of the high society in
which her husband aspired to make his career. "No one believes," he once
said, "how difficult it was for me to make out of Fraulein von Puttkamer a
Frau von Bismarck; I fully succeeded only after the deaths of her parents."82
Many of his early letters to her testify to this effort, which, despite his claim,
was never fully successful.83 Beautiful, stylish, and sophisticated women continued to attract him. Although the encounters were platonic, one was not
without cost. In 1865 he chanced to meet an acquaintance, Pauline Lucca, a
celebrated opera singer, outside their hotel in Bad Ischl (Austria) and accompanied her at her invitation to a photographer's studio, where she had an
appointment. On a whim they sat for a joint portrait, two copies of which he
sent to Johanna. But the "joke" turned sour when the photographer began
selling unauthorized prints to the public. Scandal threatened, and steps had
to be taken to compel him to destroy the plate and remaining prints.84
Johanna's chief interest in life was family and household—her husband and
children, their health, nourishment, careers, and general welfare. In 1887,
her oldest son Herbert explained to his brother-in-law, Count Kuno zu Rantzau, the dynamics of the Bismarck household. Johanna was, he said, "composed only of a sense of duty and self-denial." She had deluded herself into
thinking that she was born to serve husband and children. Even though she

enjoyed the theater, Johanna was reluctant to attend lest she neglect a family
duty or be absent when Otto needed to talk to her. To him she never admitted
any need of her own, even when he thought to inquire. Continuing selfsacrifice was a compulsion, and every lapse in fulfilling its demands left her
with a sense of guilt. In earlier years she always had a "dame de compagnie,"
as well as nannies and governesses, to share the burden of running the household; but now, although old and weak, she bore it all without assistance—
household accounts, correspondence with providers, supervision of servants,
and the like. "Service" to her husband remained her only concern, and yet
this too now had its adverse side. Even the smallest mishap in the household
sufficed to arouse her to the point of unnecessarily involving her husband. For
him the consequence was a sleepless night and passing health problem. "Papa
is himself exhausted and in need of rest; he has too much on his mind to

tants, attending to his personal needs as well as to affairs of state. Yet an
intimate friend and frequent guest found him, "despite all love," not very
interested in the personal lives of his family. "There is in him a peculiar aloofness [Fursichsein] amid wife and children."8'
While dominant in his own household, Bismarck feared that other men,
like his father, did not control theirs. His collected writings and conversations
display an almost paranoid suspicion of feminine intrigues directed against
himself and his policies by the wives of statesmen, diplomats, ministers, and
monarchs. In 1881 he bitterly opposed the marriage of his oldest son, Herbert, then thirty-two, to Princess Elisabeth von Carolath chiefly on the
grounds that she was related to Baron Walther von Loe and Count Alexander
von Schleinitz, whom the chancellor regarded as enemies in league with Empress Augusta, with whom he had feuded since 1848. Augusta he hated and
feared to the end, making her the villainess of the memoirs he composed in
retirement.88
Seen from the psychoanalytic standpoint, Bismarck's behavior in the 1870s
shows that the emotional cost of his break with old friends and fellow Junkers
was considerable. Their rejection of him reactivated trauma suffered long ago,
exacerbated his health problems, and led him to seek at hearth and dining
table the narcissistic supplies that his injured self required. Yet he did not
abandon the political arena to his foes. His response combined regression with
heightened narcissism. Within the refuge of the family, where his omnipotence was unquestioned, he forged the thunderbolts with which to strike
down obstructions to his power and policies in the political world. But even
here, surrounded by adoring people and constantly accompanied by a faithful
and protective dog, his need for love and acceptance was unsatiated. Hence
he ate and drank and demanded sympathy by complaining about his health.
Bismarck was composed of more blood than iron.
Bismarck had a remarkable talent for converting handicaps into assets. He
repeatedly exploited his bad health and nerves in order to gain his will over
the king, fellow ministers, and even the Reichstag. At moments of crisis he
often asserted that the frictions of political life were no longer endurable and
that he, if opposed, would be compelled to resign, depart for Varzin or Friedrichsruh, and leave the country to its fate. So great was his ascendancy in
German government and political life after 1870 that this tactic often

worked. Even severe critics of his domestic policy were convinced of his indispensability in foreign affairs. Objections were overcome, policies adopted,
ministers dismissed, counselors transferred, even parliamentary decisions reversed because the chancellor said his health demanded it. On the other
hand, Bismarck's frequent irritability exacerbated his relationships with colleagues, subordinates, and parliamentary deputies. Those hour-long nocturnal debates in which the pacing insomniac conjured up his opponents, rebutted their opinions, and supplied them with malignant motives were hardly
erased from his consciousness by the rising sun and slumber of exhaustion.
They left him bitter and sharp-tongued, cost him the services of able subordinates and colleagues, and imparted a harsh tone to German parliamentary
life that was one of his more unfortunate legacies.
Bismarck's physical and mental state compelled him to spend long periods
each year on his estates. Varzin was ten hours (eight by rail and two by road)
and Friedrichsruh four hours by train from Berlin. While he was there, the
telegraph key chattered and couriers came and went. The chancellor liked to
believe that he could govern as easily from Friedrichsruh as from Berlin. Yet
his lengthy absences from the nerve center of the German government complicated further the very involved bureaucratic relationships, deprived ministers and counselors of the opportunity for quick communication and exchange of information, and often produced misunderstandings as to his
policies and intentions. Even while in Berlin Bismarck's ailments compelled
him at times to curtail radically his contact with high officials; for long periods
he communicated with them only through adjutants. Jangled nerves and
physical weakness often forced him to suspend work or to limit his working
day to two hours. During some years he seldom appeared in parliament to
defend his policies, giving rise to ironical remarks about the "mythical chancellor." His condition, furthermore, was the source of frequent, unsettling
rumors, such as the story that the morphine prescribed by Struck and Schweninger against pain and sleeplessness had made him a drug addict.8' For nearly
twenty years his political allies feared and his foes hoped for his retirement.
Yet year after year, through crisis after crisis, he clung tenaciously to power
because he could not do otherwise. "He wants to remain at any cost," wrote
Roon in January 1870, "for the present and in the future, because he feels
that the structure he has begun will collapse as soon as he takes his hand
away—making him a laughingstock to the world."90

Wealth and Social Perspective

O A LATER German chancellor, Prince Bernhard von Biilow,
it was one of the great paradoxes of history that Bismarck—"the
statesman who as no other had been a product of the German
countryside, the squire of Schonhausen, and the dike reeve of
the district of Jerichow, the man of whom his wife could say, long after
he had become imperial chancellor, that a cabbage interested him more
than all his policies"—had been the "instrument of industrialization. As
the proverb says: 'What he weaves no weaver knows.' "' If one accepts
Bismarck's image of himself, that of a simple country squire driven by
an inexorable sense of duty to serve the state in an urban environment
he hated, his career does appear paradoxical. But the image is inaccurate.
More of his early years were spent in Berlin than in the countryside; he grew
up a city boy, although not by choice. He became a rich man, but more
through gifts and investments in stocks and bonds than through farming.
While most of his wealth was invested in estates and rural industries, he was
no stranger to the world of capitalism. Nor was he unaware of the progress of
social change and what it implied for the stability of the old social and political order.
The interests of agriculture and landowners remained his primary concern; yet he responded to the needs of industrial capitalism and consciously promoted the social amalgamation of the Prussian nobility and
upper bourgeoisie. He was also aware that his regime, if it were to endure, could not be based exclusively upon a coalition of propertied elites,
but must also serve the interests of the small farmer, rural laborer, artisan, and factory worker. Yet his vision failed him when it came to practical policies to be followed in building the broader consensus of social
groups and interests at which he aimed, a consensus intended to overcome the deep fissures in German society and to perpetuate the regime
he had constructed. His failure stemmed from the limitations of his own
experience and the perspective he derived from that experience, from his
narcissistic quest for personal power, and from his incomprehension of
the limits of coercion and of materialism in overcoming moral convictions.

Bismarck's Fortune
In 1838 Bismarck left government service in part because of his low opinion
of its financial prospects. He foresaw that he would be at least forty years of
age before he could marry and establish a household, by which time he expected to be "dried out from the dust of the files, a hypochondriac, ill in breast
and limbs from sitting." "I hold that the possession of a large fortune is indispensable, if one is to find any pleasure in the service of the state. Only then
can I be in a position to appear publicly with the luster I regard as appropriate
and, furthermore, be able to surrender easily all the advantages that the office
affords as soon as my official duties come into conflict with my convictions or
my taste."3 Ultimately Bismarck did acquire a fortune that gave him the independence he deemed necessary. It was, nevertheless, his career in government that led to wealth, rather than the reverse. But for his services to the
state and the connections that it brought he would never have been more
than a fairly well-to-do country squire.
In 1887 Bismarck estimated his net worth at about 12,000,000 marks, asserting that in good years when timber prices were high, this capital netted
him as much as 300,000 marks, in poor years nothing at all.3 These estimates
made to a journalist (not to the tax collector) appear to have been remarkably
close to the actual figures. In comparison with his private income, Bismarck's
annual salary as chancellor (54,000 marks) was small; he received no income
from his other offices in the Prussian government. His expenses were also
heavy, varying annually by his own estimate from 150,000 to 180,000 marks.4
There were years when he spent far more than he made. In 1884 Bismarck's
gross income reached 408,426 marks, his expenses 526,692 marks, leaving a
deficit of 118,266 marks. That year his household expenses alone reached
119,500 marks.5 Higher income and increasing capital permitted debts and
deficits on a grander scale. His wealth enabled Bismarck to give some realism
• GW, XlV, 16.
Moritz Busch, Tagebuchblatter (Leipzig, 1899), II, 220. In estimating his net worth Bismarck
apparently forgot 1,000,000 marks that he owed in mortgages to Bleichroder! His financial affairs
had become so complicated that it is difficult to be sure, even with fairly good sources, of his net
worth and annual income. Although we know how much was invested in all of his estates—
except Schonhausen I, which he inherited—it is difficult to know their actual resale value at any
one time. Schonhausen II cost 1,500,000 marks; Varzin and adjacent properties, 300,000 marks.
Friedrichsruh was worth an estimated 3,000,000 marks when acquired. During 1887-1889 his
annual net income from the estates averaged 265,400 marks. By 1890 he possessed a portfolio of
securities worth about 1,200,000 marks, which at an estimated 4 percent would have yielded
48,000 marks. Hence a private income of 300,000 marks (excluding salary) appears about right.

to his frequent threats of resignation in the 1870s and 1880s. The ways in
which it was acquired and invested are important, furthermore, for an understanding of the perspective from which he viewed the problems of political
economy.
Bismarck's father, Ferdinand von Bismarck, owned four estates located in
Brandenburg (Schonhausen) and Pomerania (Kniephof, Kiilz, Jarchelin), all
of which were heavily mortgaged. From 1821 to 1839 Ferdinand was an absentee landlord, residing in Berlin, living off rents paid by the leaseholders of
these properties. It was a period of depressed prices and low rents in agriculture, and Berlin was fairly expensive. By his gambling, traveling, and high
living, furthermore, Otto had incurred debts so "enormous" that he concealed them from his family. Hence he concurred in the family decision to
leave Berlin. Otto and brother Bernhard took over the management of the
Pomeranian properties in 1838, while Ferdinand assumed that of Schonhausen after his wife's death in 1839. On the father's death in 1845, the sons
divided the inheritance. Otto received the two tax-free knight's estates (Rittergiiter) of Schonhausen and Kniephof and, as compensation, assumed onehalf of the real estate tax on the nonnoble estates of Kiilz and Jarchelin taken
by Bernhard.
Bismarck's "flight" to the country did not end his financial problems. Kniephof, valued at 80,000 to 90,000 thalers, still had an indebtedness of about
38,000 thalers in 1847, while the burden on Schonhausen, valued at about
90,000 thalers, was 60,000 thalers.6 Even if no new debts had been contracted, Bismarck would have needed most of his life to free his property from
this encumbrance. Kniephof, too distant to be administered from Schonhausen, was leased in 1847. In November 1848 the master of Schonhausen contemplated selling the property "in order to put an end to all of my financial
embarrassment with one blow." But apparently he succeeded in raising from
a friend the 3,500 thalers needed to pay off a pressing creditor. This gave him
time to negotiate another bank loan and to lease the estate (except for house
and garden) in the following year. Evidently the lessees of Kniephof and
Schonhausen knew how to make them pay, but not the owner.7 Together the
two estates yielded about 7,300 thalers annually, of which 4,000 went to the

bankers, leaving Bismarck, now married and starting a family, with a modest
income of about 3,300 thalers.8 Election to the lower chamber qualified him
for a per diem allowance of one thaler while parliament was in session. Yet he
was soon compelled, in order to make ends meet, to rent even the house and
garden at Schonhausen, where he had intended to spend his summers.9
As Prussian envoy to the Frankfurt Diet after 1851 Bismarck had an annual
salary of 18,000 thalers. His new station, however, was expensive. In October
1855 he wrote to his brother that the entertainment (dieser Saus and Braus)
expected of him in Frankfurt made it difficult to stay within his income. The
transfer to Russia in 1859 brought an increase in salary to 33,000 thalers, but
the cost of moving (10,000 thalers) was high; St. Petersburg was much more
expensive than Frankfurt; and his tenure in the post (two years) was short.10
Near bankruptcy, religious conversion, and marriage, however, had sobered
Bismarck. His days of profligacy were over; he was determined to save and
accumulate. According to the letter of 1855, he applied the lease money from
his estates to the amortization of their mortgages. By selling Rentenbriefe (that
is, bonds issued by a state Rentenbank created under a statute of 1850 to liquidate peasant obligations remaining from the abolition of serfdom) he apparently acquired capital with which to start investing on the bourse."
At Frankfurt Bismarck acquired the financial services of Baron Meyer Carl
von Rothschild and through him those of the Rothschild banking houses in
Vienna, London, and Paris—the shrewdest and best informed investment
counselors in Europe. The Frankfurt Rothschilds continued to manage the
bulk of Bismarck's invested capital until 1867 when the end of the constitutional conflict made it safe for him to transfer his account to the Berlin banking house of Gerson Bleichroder. A correspondent of the Rothschilds in the
Prussian capital, Bleichroder first became involved with Bismarck in 1859,
when the latter needed a Berlin banker to receive and disburse his salary as
ambassador to St. Petersburg and later to Paris. The Jewish banker continued
to perform his function after Bismarck returned to Berlin as Prussian ministerpresident in 1862. While the financial services of the Rothschilds and
Bleichroder were available to anyone of means, these private bankers were
doubly conscious of the wisdom of looking after the interests of anyone with
political status. With the proper alchemy political connections could easily
be converted into gold. Even before he took full charge of Bismarck's account
in 1866-1867 Bleichroder had begun to give his special client investment

advice and to offer him stock options on railway and banking shares floated
by the Bleichroder firm. By mid-1867 Bismarck had accumulated nearly
200,000 thalers (600,000 marks) in liquid assets.12
While Bismarck had become well-to-do by 1866, the dotations of 1867 and
1871 made him rich. The 400,000 thalers he received in 1867 was granted
with the condition that it be spent to purchase an entailed estate. Since this
did not cover the cost of Varzin, Bleichroder advanced additional funds (with­
out interest!), which Bismarck repaid through the sale of securities.13 On ac­
quiring Varzin (14,200 acres with seven villages), he began to lust after ad­
joining properties. "Every evening," he told visitors in 1868, "I develop a
passion to annex these estates; in the morning I can look at them calmly."14
In the end desire overcame him. By 1874 the total investment at Varzin had
reached 20,000 acres worth about 700,000 thalers (2,100,000 marks), part of
which was raised through the sale of Kniephof to a nephew. Originally the
Sachsenwald comprised 16,875 acres valued at 1,000,000 thalers (3,000,000
marks), normally yielding about 34,000 thalers (102,000 marks) annually. In
order to establish a residence there he paid an additional 255,000 marks for
the inn and park at Friedrichsruh in 1879. As at Varzin he could not resist
further purchases, which eventually brought the total to 20,400 acres. "When
a neighbor's property wedges itself into mine," he told Busch, "and I see a fine
clump of trees on it that are going to be cut down, I must buy that piece of
ground."15
This compulsive buying sometimes caused the great annexationist to pay
too much for what he got and to accumulate new debts that burdened his
income despite mortgages of nearly 1,000,000 marks provided by the faithful
Bleichroder at low rates of interest and amortization. Two additional proper­
ties came to him without personal expense. In 1871 his wife inherited the
Rittergut of Reinfeld in Pomerania, and in 1885, as mentioned earlier, a public
subscription (supplemented by a gift of 350,000 marks from a group of bank­
ers) enabled him to purchase Schonhausen II at a cost of 1,500,000 marks.
With Schonhausen I the Brandenburg property now totalled nearly 5,000
acres. l6

By far the smallest of his major possessions, Schonhausen lay on the east
bank of the river Elbe in Brandenburg's Altmark; most of it was bottom land
and its rich alluvial soil was best suited for grain crops. In the 1870s Bismarck
preferred to reside at Varzin. Located on hilly moraine left by the glaciers,
Varzin's soil was sandy and marshy, suitable only for timber and potatoes. As
an income-producer Varzin was for many years a disappointment. "In my financial affairs I have no luck, perhaps no skill," Bismarck wrote to his brother
in July 1871. "At any rate I do not have enough time to concern myself about
them. My situation was good before I received the first dotation. Since then
Varzin consumes everything." The previous owner had felled far more trees
than he planted, and reforestation was expensive.17 The Varzin books were
further unbalanced by an employee who embezzled more than 30,000 marks
before committing suicide in 1877.l8 His disappointment over Varzin was one
reason why Bismarck chose Friedrichsruh as his principal country residence
in that year.IO
To Bismarck's irritation the public gained a false impression of his income.
By July 1871 he was receiving several dozen letters daily requesting "at least
20,000 thalers in loans." During the 1860s he had often responded to requests
for help, sending Keudell with as much as twenty-five thalers to succor needy
persons. But now Bettelbriefe were returned to the senders. The "handsome
revenue" he expected to receive from the Sachsenwald would be gratifying,
he wrote, if only he wasn't expected to live like a "prince." In view of his
actual circumstances, the new title was a "swindle." Perhaps his oldest son
Herbert, if he lived long enough and were more clever, could extract a
princely income from the former domain.20
Since agriculture alone did not suffice to make his estates pay, Bismarck
attacked his financial problem by becoming a petty rural industrialist—an activity that added a new dimension to his economic experience. Like other
Pomeranian estate owners, he found it profitable to dispose of his potato crop
as alcohol rather than food. By 1884 he possessed at Varzin two distilleries
with an annual capacity of 179,604 liters.21 The Wipper River that flowed

across that estate provided water power for three factories that converted
wood pulp into paper. Constructed at Bismarck's expense in 1868-1869,
1870-1873, and 1875-1876, the plants were leased to the brothers Moritz
and Georg Behrend, businessmen at nearby Koslin, who contracted to buy
their wood from the Varzin forests at a fixed price. During the late 1870s and
1880s this enterprise was intermittently in difficulty. The brothers quarreled,
boilers burst, a plant burned down, a flood came, and insolvency threatened.
Yet Bismarck disregarded Bleichroder's advice to abandon the Behrends and
even lent them money to keep the plants in operation. He had a good reason.
By the 1880s these Jewish businessmen paid 78,018 (ultimately 87,105)
marks yearly for the privilege of manufacturing pulp in Bismarck's mills; they
had become his chief source of income at Varzin.22
Friedrichsruh also had industries. At Duneberg on the Elbe Bismarck leased
to Koln-Rottweiler Pulverfaimken a site for construction of a plant to manufacture explosives—with the proviso that fuel be purchased from the Sachsenwald. Initially the lease brought the prince 10,900 marks annually, later
nearly twice that amount. Whether this firm had government contracts is
unknown; if so, there is as yet no evidence that Bismarck intervened to secure
them. At Schonau, another Sachsenwald property, he constructed and leased
another distillery in 1886. In comparison with Varzin, the Sachsenwald had
easily accessible timber markets—in Hamburg, England, and the Ruhr. Be-

ginning in 1878 Bismarck's best customer in the Ruhr was Friedrich Vohwinkel, a wholesaler at Gelsenkirchen, who supplied pit props to coal mines. In
turn, Vohwinkel's best customer was the Hibernia corporation, one of the
largest industrial enterprises in Germany. As a member of Hibernia's board of
directors, Bleichroder was in a position to influence its purchasing contracts.
Prompted at the appropriate time by Head Forester Peter Lange, Bismarck's
manager at Friedrichsruh, the banker intervened to make sure that Hibernia
renewed its contracts with Vohwinkel—at a good price in a falling market.
By 1886, Vohwinkel, who always paid on time and never made difficulties (so
Lange reminded Bleichroder), had paid "a full million" for Sachsenwald timber. That Bismarck began in 1879 to take more interest in the financial condition of heavy industry in the Ruhr was not unconnected with his own business operations.23 An even more direct relationship between his business
interests and governmental policies can be seen in his reaction in 1882-1883
to the attempt of a prospering insurance company to increase the premiums
on buildings located on his Sachsenwald property: he seriously proposed to
nationalize all incorporated fire and hail insurers and moved the Ministry of
Justice to prosecute charges of insurance fraud. Nor were the terms under
which Bismarck advocated in 1886 a state liquor monopoly (higher prices for
raw alcohol distilled by landowners) unconnected with his own investments.24
Critics accused Bismarck of administering the Reich like an east-Elbian
estate.25 While this was unfair, it is certainly true that his pursuit of a private
fortune shows the same personal drive to acquire, consolidate, and control
that he exhibited in public affairs. Recent research has shown that his personal involvement in the management of his securities portfolio was greater
than had been assumed. Bleichroder advised, but Bismarck disposed.26 The
same is true of the handling of his landed property. He demanded from his
administrators detailed reports on such matters as the extent of acreage tilled,
crops sown, fertilizer used, timber planted and cut, the costs incurred and
prices gained. "A landed property about which I do not know anything holds
no interest for me, and the yield from a share of stock is higher than from real
estate."27 If the yield was higher, the risk was greater and personal interest
less.

that went on in his forests from the nursery to the sawmill. His long daily
walks and rides had as their aim not only exercise and relaxation, but also the
close supervision of the work of his employees. With the help of a forestry
expert, John Booth, he experimented, not always successfully, with imported
varieties of deciduous trees from Japan and America, particularly Douglas
firs.28 His choice of trees reveals his basic conservatism in most business affairs, "Pine can on occasion bring you a nice piece of money," he once remarked, "but it is apt to undergo great changes, and I prefer deciduous forests.
The latter may be compared to Prussian Consols, pine forests to speculative
stock." His greatest love were the Schonungen, stands of trees that were never
to be cut. "I love the big trees; they are ancestors."29
According to one observer, Bismarck was not a good manager despite his
attention to detail. Although parsimonious, he was the victim of waste and
theft. The Bismarck household was "impractical and awkward," unequal to
the demands made on it by his position and hospitality. The master resisted
innovations, insisting that everything remain as it had been. He was dubious
of technical progress, including the introduction of water pipes and electric
lights. In building he had "little skill." Advised that a chimney design was
defective, he built it anyhow—and was not particularly aroused over the resulting fire. Preparations for his frequent travels were usually delayed and disorganized, to the distress of his aides and servants. He was hardly aware of the
inefficiency that surrounded him and took umbrage when anyone tried to
bring it to his attention.30

Conflicts of Interest
"I am in a position," Bismarck wrote to the Prussian minister of commerce in
1877, "to observe the effect of our legislative and administrative labors because I belong to the governed, not merely to the governing and law-making
class, and can personally feel the effects of faulty legislation." In Bismarck's
terminology to be among the "governed" was to be a property owner; yet he
despised absentee landlords and "coupon-clippers" who let others manage
their wealth. The "governed" were active property owners, particularly agrarian and industrial entrepreneurs. "I am the only minister who concerns himself with his estates and knows the faults of our laws and all their chicanery,"
he complained in 1880. "Most ministers are people of the feather, not

leather."31 His low opinion of the bureaucracy and of legislatures stemmed
from the conviction that most officials and politicians had no experience in
practical affairs. Hence he often intervened on every level of the governmental structure both to set things right and to prevent "too much governing."
Some of these interventions directly affected Bismarck's private affairs. In
1869 Itzenplitz irritated him by refusing to discipline petty officials in Brandenburg who, in executing a public work, dug a ditch across a Schonhausen
meadow before asking for permission, which he admittedly was willing to
grant. By 1886 he had more clout, intervening at the Ministry of War to
prevent the quartering of troops at Schonhausen during military maneuvers.32
His worst feuds, however, were with Pomeranian officials over his interests at
Varzin. In 1869-1870 he complained successfully to the ministers of trade and
agriculture over the conduct of the district governor von Gotze in Koslin, who
had defended the rights of lumbermen, who wished to continue using the
Wipper for rafting, against Bismarck and the Behrends, who wished to dam it
for water power. A few years later he got the Ministry of Education to restore
a school subsidy, whose withdrawal would have increased the taxes on Misdow, one of his properties adjacent to Varzin.33 When the royal factory inspector for Pomerania ordered the Behrends to correct conditions dangerous
to their workers in the pulp mills on the Wipper, his diligence earned him an
interview with the mighty German chancellor at Varzin. His superior, Minister of Commerce Achenbach, received a memorandum in which Bismarck
questioned the new system of factory inspection as an unnecessary irritant to
factory owners, whose consequences were certain to be felt in the next election.34
There are stories of similar interventions with local authorities in Lauenburg, the location of the Sachsenwald and Friedrichsruh. Acquired from Denmark in 1864 and purchased from Austria at Gastein in 1865, the duchy of
Lauenburg was governed as a separate entity until its incorporation into Prussia as a county in 1876. Bismarck was its minister and for this service received
a salary of 4,000 thalers yearly until he took legal possession of the Sachsenwald in 1872. During the period 1872-1876 he is alleged to have paid no
property tax (assessed at 1,500 marks annually). According to another story,

he later intervened at the Ministry of Interior to force the local Landrat to
abandon a tax surcharge needed to balance the county budget. On another
occasion he is said to have opposed an increase in the tax rate to be used to
hire a second teacher for an overcrowded school ("It is not necessary that the
children learn more"). He is also said to have coerced the county government
(Did the town of Molln want to lose its garrison?) into presenting him with
an island in an adjacent lake worth 5,000 marks and a public building in the
Sachsenwald worth 40,000 marks. Roads chiefly beneficial to the prince's log­
ging operations were said to have been constructed at public expense.35
Whatever the cause, the Bismarcks were not very popular in the region; in
1878 Herbert stood for a Reichstag seat from Lauenburg and was defeated.
In his struggle with local authorities, Bismarck had weapons not accessible
to the ordinary citizen. In 1881 he gleefully related to the Reichstag that,
because he possessed the "latch to legislation," he had gotten Varzin trans­
ferred from the county of Schlawe, dominated by ultraconservative oppo­
nents, to that of Rummelsberg, whose officials were "more tolerant" toward
his interests.36 At the other end of the political spectrum Bismarck quarreled
with the city government of Berlin, dominated by progressives, over its as­
sessment of horse and rent taxes. In order to limit the latter, he introduced a
bill in the Reichstag that restricted the assessed rental value of rent-free dwell­
ings provided for Reich officials to 10 percent of their salaries. Although the
Reichstag raised the figure to 15 percent, Bismarck was still able to save 115
marks yearly, a petty sum for a man of his means.37
Bismarck's biggest struggle against taxes, however, was with the income tax
commission. Higher incomes in Prussia were taxed under a "classified income
tax" assessed by a local commission elected either by the county diet or city
council. The tax—3 percent of the assessed income—was hardly onerous.

4iff., and Von Rechts nach Links (Zurich, 1937), pp. 78ff. Gerlach was a distant relative of Leo­
pold and Ludwig von Gerlach. His stories about Bismarck are mostly unverified and may be
distorted or exaggerated. There is evidence, however, that Bismarck sought to punish the town
of Molln by withdrawing its garrison, ostensibly on political not financial grounds. See GW, VIc,
274. That such stories were rife in the neighborhood is evident in Ernst Feder, ed., Bismarcks

sessed by estimating what rental the dwelling would bring if privately owned and rented. Bis­
marck claimed that his political enemies (progressives controlled the city of Berlin) on the board
of assessment had not only placed the figure too high, but had also overestimated the amount of
space occupied by the Bismarck family in the chancellery. He objected to the horse tax assess­
ment (three and a half marks) because he owned no horses in Berlin, the assessing official having
estimated the number of horses by the number of stalls. Forckenbeck, mayor of Berlin, replied
that Bismarck had failed to object to the estimate in the alloted time. His critics found it astound­
ing that the chancellor of Germany should take up the time of the Reichstag with such petty
matters.

80

* The Reich of Iron and Blood *

Self-assessment did not yet exist, and the commission had no authority to
requisition private financial records. It had to estimate the taxpayer's probable
income in view of his real property and, in Bismarck's case, his government
salary. Since 1865 Bismarck had been placed in the eighteenth bracket
(24,000 to 32,000 thalers); in December 1870, while he was in France, the
commission elevated him to the nineteenth (from 32,000 to 40,000 thalers).
In March 1871 Johanna filed a "remonstrance," and Bismarck followed it up
belatedly in July, protesting that even the eighteenth bracket was unjust. In
October the commission relented and left the chancellor in the eighteenth
bracket, evidently accepting Bismarck's estimate of his total income at 24,500
thalers (73,500 marks). A tax "reform" of 1873 introduced no change in the
assessment procedure, but narrowed the brackets and extended them beyond
the previous upper limit (thirty). In 1876-1877 the commission elevated Bismarck to bracket thirty-one (204,000 to 240,000 marks) with a tax bill of
6,120 marks. There he remained until 1890, after fighting off another challenge from the commission in 1880. Since he viewed all direct taxation as
unsound, Bismarck had little compunction about cheating on his income
tax.38
Bismarck's documented interventions are generally couched in terms of
principle and the public interest. He wrote of the necessity of protecting property rights, of the dangers of abusing taxpayers who were also voters, using his
own case merely to illustrate intolerable errors on the part of the bureaucracy
that alienated the public. He explained the gerrymandering of Varzin and his
insistence on a national rent-tax law as a justifiable defense against punitive
actions by political foes, who wanted him to "atone in my private life for my
sins as a minister."39 Certainly Bismarck had the same right of redress possessed by every citizen in a Rechtsstaat. Yet he was no ordinary citizen, as his
colleagues and subordinates were well aware. His critics may be pardoned for
failing to see the distinction, so clear in Bismarck's own mind, between his
roles as governor and governed. What to Bismarck was a defense of principle
or an assertion of personal rights appeared to others, like Helmut von Gerlach, to be a misuse of public office for personal gain. As the novelist Theodor
Fontane saw it, these traits revealed a petty side to the prince's character that
cost him public favor in the 1880s. "This mixture of superman and artful

of costing the state money for his own convenience. If he let his property be expropriated, on
the other hand, he would be accused of wanting a new mansion at public expense. GW, VIlI,

howler, . . . doesn't permit me to have a pure, bright admiration for him."4°
By the standards of his age, nevertheless, Bismarck's conception of what
was honorable in a royal official and of what is today called "conflict of interest" was relatively high. In the recent past it had been common for statesmen
(Metternich being a prominent example) to accept retainers from foreign
governments. In private Bismarck accused two of his predecessors, Otto von
Manteuffel and Alexander von Schleinitz, of being in the pay of Vienna and
asserted that he had indignantly refused a bribe offered by an Austrian agent
in 1859.41 Yet his strong feelings on this score did not prevent him from corrupting others through the Guelph fund, particularly the public press whose
venality he so often denounced. By Bismarck's time the greatest danger of
corruption for ministers and officials was to be found on the bourse rather than
in foreign chancelleries. In February 1854 Bismarck gave Meyer Carl von
Rothschild advance news, gained by Foreign Office telegram, of the start of
the Crimean War; yet he refused (without indignation) the banker's offer to
speculate on credit ("Excellency won't risk anything").42 He did sell securities
in 1857 in the expectation, based on official information, that Prussia would
attack Switzerland over the issue of Neuchatel. But peace prevailed and the
securities prospered.43
At dinner one day in early December 1870 Bismarck denied "the possibility
of turning to much account the always limited knowledge that one may have
of approaching political events. Such events only affect the bourse afterwards,
and the day when that is going to happen cannot be foreseen."44 Could he
really have forgotten so soon that on Sunday, July 10, 1870, he had informed
Bleichroder, in reply to the latter's inquiry, that it might be a "good idea" to
unload the railway shares in the Bismarck portfolio and that on July 11 rumors
of impending war had sent the Berlin stock exchange into sharp decline?45

the market skyward, he had instructed Bleichroder to sell "whatever you deem
correct," knowing that peace, contrary to popular expectations, was still a
46
long way off?
In later years he boasted that he had been wise enough to sell his Russian
bonds in 1874, when he heard that Count Peter Shuvalov, "the smartest
man" in St. Petersburg, was being sent as ambassador to London. He antici­
pated "follies" on the part of the Russian government in Balkan affairs. But
this was more "poetic hindsight" than foresight, for the Russo-Turkish War
was still three years away. Bismarck's liquidation of his Austrian and Russian
bonds in 1873-1874 appears to have been based more on general market con­
ditions than on political predictions.47 After twenty years of investing in for­
eign government bonds, however, he now decided against it on principle;
"such things disturb the vision of a foreign minister and ought not to be." 4 8
Except for a brief and unsuccessful foray into Russian bonds in 1885, he ap­
pears to have carried out his resolve until 1889. "I want to interest myself in
my own country and not in foreign securities," he told the Reichstag in May
1889.49 But shortly thereafter he began to exchange his German government
bonds for Egyptian and Mexican bonds. On March 8 and 13, as the final crisis
in his relationship to Wilhelm II mounted, he liquidated the rest of his hold­
ings in favor of more Egyptian securities. Did he speculate on his own dis­
missal? At any rate the Berlin bourse, which had declined for some months,
plunged briefly on news of his departure, while the Egyptian bonds grew in
value.5"
All of these financial operations have one thing in common: they were
defensive, aimed at the preservation of capital rather than its increase. Had
he been challenged, Bismarck would certainly have maintained that there
was nothing unethical about them. What he found reprehensible can be seen
in his criticism of Manteuffel who used the foreign service to gain fast infor­
mation on movements of foreign stock markets. Even more blameworthy was
the deliberate manipulation of political events in order to influence the price
of securities, a practice of which he accused Gramont in 1870.5I One of the
reasons for his anger at Harry von Arnim was the belief that the diplomat had
delayed carrying out an instruction in Paris because of the beneficial effect it
would have on the bourse, where he was speculating ά baisse.52
The most questionable transaction in which Bismarck and Bleichroder en­
gaged never became public knowledge. In 1875 Bismarck launched a major

project for the nationalization of the Reich's railways, the details of which
will be discussed in a later chapter. Although the proposal failed in the
Reichstag, Prussia did convert all of its railways to public ownership. The
intention to nationalize the railways was public knowledge, for the matter was
debated at great length in the Prussian Landtag, Bundesrat, and Reichstag.
To purchase depressed railway shares in the expectation that the price would
rise before nationalization was a course open to every investor with the necessary capital. Still such purchases tended to stop the downward trend of railway stocks on the bourse and ultimately to drive up the price. Hence it was
ethically dubious for the chancellor of the German Reich, who had advance
knowledge of the order in which the lines were likely to be purchased, to
invest more than half of his liquid capital in those railways, buying and selling
shares valued at more than a million marks over eight years, before most of
the major lines were finally in the hands of the government.
Bleichroder, who played an important role in overcoming bureaucratic obstacles to nationalization, also invested heavily in the same railway companies
as did his famous client. To Albert Maybach, Prussian minister of public
works, who was charged with the execution of the nationalization policy,
speculation of this sort by insiders and well connected outsiders was morally
outrageous. In 1879, during the Landtag debate on the first nationalization
bill, Maybach denounced the bourse as a "poison tree" casting a fateful
shadow on the life of the nation. Was the chancellor of the German Reich
one of the poisoners? In percentage terms his capital gains were modest but
sure—2 to 10 percent over a few months. He may well have rationalized the
purchases on the grounds that by voting his shares for nationalization he was
performing a public service. But in all probability he was not troubled by the
problem.53
"Bismarck," wrote Fritz Stern, "would have felt that to ignore the intelligence his position brought him would be tantamount to self-injury. The idea
that power should be resolutely unprofitable, that public and private interests
might be incompatible because the latter might corrupt the former, did not
occur to Bismarck or to other nineteenth-century giants. Power, they knew,
brought pain and tribulation as well as exhilaration and possible fame; it certainly should command deference and loyalty, and if these proved profitable,
tant mieux. Profit was no threat to their integrity nor impoverishment an acceptable reward for service to king and country."54
Diplomacy was not the only channel through which a statesman or official
could exploit the bourse for private gain. Many officials, lords, and deputies
participated in the wild speculation of the Grunderjahre (1870-1873), and
some used their bureaucratic and political influence to profit from railway con53

cessions and the licensing of joint-stock companies. In Reichstag speeches in
January and February 1873 Eduard Lasker brought the scandal to public atten­
tion, months before the crash proved that many of these ventures were dubi­
ous. The consequence was that several accused officials were compelled to
resign, including notably Hermann Wagener. During the following years ru­
mors spread that the dimensions of the scandal were even greater than Lasker
had shown; eventually they surfaced in articles published by Franz Perrot in
the Kreuzzeitung (the "era articles" of June 1875), pamphlets written by Otto
von Diest-Daber (September-November 1876), articles in the weekly Die
deutsche Reichsghcke (October 1876), and the writings of Rudolph Meyer
(1876-1877).55

From evidence recently made available in the Bleichroder papers, it ap­
pears that Bismarck did not participate in the speculative orgy of the Grunderjahre. Under Bleichroder's guidance he preferred conservative purchases
whose resale turned a modest but persistent profit. The most serious accusa­
tion leveled against him by the scandalmongers of the late 1870s was that a
consortium of bankers, including Bleichroder, had rewarded him for his help
in chartering the Preussische Central-Boden-Credit-AktiengeseUschaft founded
in 1870 by granting him a stock option (1,000,000 thalers worth of shares)
that produced a windfall profit of 83,000 thalers. There followed a series of
sensational trials for libel (January and February 1877), which ended in judg­
ments against Diest-Daber, Meyer, and two editors of Reichsghcke, all of
whom were sentenced to several months in prison. In addition, Diest-Daber,
a prominent Junker, was dismissed from the officer corps.56
Although the principal accusation was untrue, these trials did make public
for the first time important details about Bismarck's financial dealings and his
relationship to Gerson Bleichroder. Later in this chapter it will be shown that
the chancellor did promote the founding of Boden-Credit, whose charter gave
it a privileged position among German mortgage banks. Modeled on the Cre­
dit fonder de France, the bank was established to supply credit to agrarian
landowners. While funded by private capital, its president was appointed and
its directors were confirmed by the Prussian government. Undoubtedly there
was need for such an enterprise, for the absorption of German capital in in­
dustrial enterprises during the 1860s had limited the credit available in agri­
culture. Its needs could not be met by provincial state banks (Landschaften)
and private mortgage banks. Not subject to the same legal restrictions, BodenCredit could issue loans more speedily and on better terms than ordinary banks
engaged in the same business.
Since he was both Bismarck's personal banker and a member of the bankers'

consortium financing BodenOredit, Bleichroder was called upon to testify during the libel action against Diest-Daber. The banker swore that the charges
were false. "More than fifteen years ago when Prince Bismarck became a Prussian minister, he commissioned me to conduct all of his financial affairs. My
task was to take care of all income and expenditures for him, to buy and sell
securities and properties. I was instructed by the prince in all purchases of
securities to direct my attention less toward profits than toward basic security.
How little time Prince Bismarck found to care for his private affairs can be
shown by the fact that he asked me some time ago whether he then owned or
ever had owned Preussische Central-Boden-Credit shares. To be certain I ordered my chief bookkeeper to investigate immediately and was able to report
to his serene highness that he did possess Boden-Credit bonds, but not
shares."57 While the mortgage bonds that Bismarck held in the amount of
400,000 thalers were an income-bearing, not a speculative investment, their
purchase did represent a kind of "cut in" arrangement by which financiers
rewarded favored customers.58 Although not guilty of the charges made
against him, Bismarck can be criticized for a "conflict of interest" that now,
although perhaps not then, would be regarded as ethically dubious.

Support for "Traditional" Social Groups
As shown earlier, Bismarck's economic views were until 1851 the conventional ones appropriate to his background and financial interests. He was opposed to free enterprise, backed guilds, condemned property taxes, favored
indirect taxes and low tariffs, distrusted joint-stock enterprises, and was generally anti-industrial and anticapitalistic. During his years in the bustling
commercial and financial center at Frankfurt, he came to appreciate the political gains Prussia could make by favoring the interests of industrial capitalism. The renewal of the Zollverein in 1853 without Austria's inclusion was
proof that those interests could be harnessed by Prussia. The constitutional
conflict of 1862-1866 awakened Bismarck to the political potential of the
urban workingman. Yet the actual course followed by the Prussian government during those years was not hostile to the interests of German capitalism
and may have contributed to the turnabout of Mittelstand attitudes in 18661867.59
Bismarck's adoption of a national policy required the positive cooperation
of business interests over a period of years for the purpose of consolidating the
union. The flood of legislation that passed through the Reichstag and Bundesrat after 1867 not only furthered that consolidation but also realized goals

that German businessmen had sought for decades: freedom of migration and
settlement (1867); uniform weights and measures (1868); a common commercial code and a supreme court to interpret it (1869); an industrial code
guaranteeing free enterprise (1869); uniform system of coinage based on the
mark (1871); and a central bank of issue, the Reichsbank (1875). For German
financiers the most important statute of all was that abolishing government
control over the establishment of joint-stock companies (1870). Henceforth
the founders of a corporation needed only to register the company with a
government agency in order to establish it as a juridical person. The long
struggle against government restrictions on use of the joint-stock company in
industry and banking had ended. These many statutes, particularly the latter,
represented the final "breakthrough" of industrial capitalism in Germany, a
major victory for entrepreneurs in banking and industry.
The economic legislation of 1867-1875 was primarily the work of Rudolf
Delbriick (now chief of the chancellor's office) and of Prussian ministers and
counselors—in collaboration with the liberal parties of the Reichstag. Yet the
course they steered for nearly a decade followed logically from Bismarck's decision of 1866 and from the policy of internal consolidation that was his chief
concern during this epoch. To conservative critics it appeared that the Bismarck government had abandoned the interests of agrarian landowners in
favor of industrial capitalism. The Junker in the Wilhelmstrasse seemed to
have betrayed the interests of his own caste. This was untrue. Bismarck intervened repeatedly in the operations of the government during these years to
promote the interests of "traditional social classes," that is, the artisans, small
businessmen, and estate owners—particularly the latter.
The onset of war in June 1866 came during a business recession. News of
impending hostilities induced a sharp drop on the bourse, a shrinkage in capital available for credit and investment, and a liquidity crisis among small and
large business enterprises. The Prussian government met the problem by lifting the legal limits on interest rates and, as in 1848, by creating loan offices
(Darhhnskassen) to extend credit to business enterprises in Berlin and other
major cities. On June 11, the day on which war became irrevocable, Bismarck
took time out from pressing diplomatic business to dictate an opinion (Votum)
for the Prussian cabinet in which he complained that the measures taken had
largely benefited merchants and big industrialists, but not those interests usually hardest hit by such crises: the landowners, small manufacturers, and artisans. Landowners, he declared, were particularly vulnerable to the demands
of creditors and to foreclosures. Yet agriculture was the "most important and
essential industry" in Prussia, not only because it employed more workers than
any other, but also because "the landowners' capacity for achievement is always decisive for the staying power of a state." For the current crisis he proposed measures to ease mortgage payments and suspend imprisonment for
debt. For the future he called for new means to counterbalance the power of

* Wealth and Social Perspective *

87

"big capital over small" and to protect landowners and small businessmen
from the "unbridled and arbitrary power" of the finance companies. Other
messages sent to individual ministers at this time had a similar purpose: (i)
he endorsed the request of a bank, Schuster and Company, for financial support from the treasury on the grounds that its clients were chiefly artisans and
small manufacturers; (2) he supported the petition of the Prussian Artisans
Association for an end to certain exemptions to the industrial code granted
in 1865 to local manufacturers for the training of apprentices outside the
guild; and (3) he proposed that the city of Berlin employ "breadless workers"
on street projects, if they were permanent residents, and, if not, order them
to move to rural areas where a labor shortage was imminent.60
Although Prussia's stunning military victory solved the immediate financial
crisis, the depression lingered on. In 1867 it was deepened by a bad harvest
that drove up grain prices and produced widespread suffering in the eastern
regions of the monarchy (particularly the districts of Konigsberg and Gumbinnen). Bismarck was sharply critical of the seeming inability of the ministries
of interior and commerce either to alleviate the distress or even to collect
adequate information on its extent. He was especially concerned over the
paucity of information on the part played by the Konigsberg grain exchange
in the crisis, a lack that revealed a more serious defect: namely, that the state
did not possess the organs to keep it in touch with "real life." The Prussian
bureaucratic organism, he complained to Eulenburg and Itzenplitz, had been
designed to meet the needs of a "state subsisting on agriculture." But recent
developments had transformed the "basic character of the state" (significantly, he wrote of "state" rather than "society") and brought into being new
structures for which there were no corresponding regulatory or informationgathering agencies within the government. The grain and stock exchanges
had grown "without limitation or supervision" and in ways that were dangerous to the "solidity of our industry" and the economy in general. He proposed
to Itzenplitz a new government agency to monitor operations of the bourse,
advising on new forms of taxation and on ways to curb "unfruitful speculation," particularly in foreign securities. In addition, he suggested that the government follow the British example by creating a suitable organ to gather
information on the "condition of the working classes, agrarian as well as industrial, including the small artisan." Itzenplitz rejected all but the latter suggestion, maintaining that attempts to regulate the bourse, tax its operations,
and curb speculation would do more harm than good.6'
From reports supplied by the Ministry of Finance Bismarck concluded (January 1868) that the plight of smaller artisans in the eastern towns was worst
and proposed that services of the loan offices created in 1866 be extended to

include them, "so they can help themselves out of the present calamity." But
the "bigger landowners" were also in difficulty and he expected that their
adversity would soon take on "greater dimensions." Credits extended by the
government provided a palliative, but were subject to abuses that Bismarck
was quick to associate with his political foes. What the chancellor wanted was
a lasting solution to the credit problems of estate owners. While at Varzin in
August 1868 he seized upon a plan conceived by Ernst Senfft von Pilsach,
who proposed to lease his estates and sugar mill to a consortium of Rhenish
financiers. Bismarck hoped that other landowners would follow the same
course, thereby gaining the freedom "to make possible their desirable participation in the political affairs of the country." Only in the west could the
capital be found to "take over larger leases." He hoped to set in motion a
"stream of prosperous and intelligent leaseholders from the Rhine province to
Pomerania and other eastern regions," which would increase land values and
promote general prosperity in the area. But Rhenish financiers showed no
interest in such projects. Rather than deal directly with the vagaries of crops,
weather, and harvests, they preferred to risk their capital indirectly in mortgages issued by a giant bank on the pattern of the Credit fonder de France.63
Naturally Bismarck was conscious of the political value of showing his fellow landowners that the government, despite its green light to industrial capitalism, did not neglect their financial interests. Yet his efforts to create mortgage banks for agrarian landowners predated his difficulties with the
conservatives in the Prussian Landtag. In March 1863 he had urged his colleagues to consider the respective merits of two major projects for mortgage
banks put forward by rival consortiums of bankers and wealthy nobility. But
the legal guidelines they established (June 1863) permitted only small institutions that soon proved to be unviable. Bismarck included mortgage law
among the legislative powers granted the North German Confederation, and
one of his first acts after the constitution went into effect was to initiate in
the Bundesrat an inquiry about the advisability of erecting a central mortgage
bank under the auspices of the confederation. The committee charged with
the inquiry concluded that neither a state bank nor a state-supported private
bank was desirable. And nothing came of the proposal (March 1868) for a
large confederate mortgage bank based on the common liability of the borrowers (urban and rural), a device intended, according to the prospectus, to "solder the regions of the confederation together as in fire."63
Finally in October 1868 Baron Abraham von Oppenheim, a Cologne
banker, presented a practicable plan and the promise of adequate financing.
He proposed a corporate mortgage bank to be capitalized by French financiers

in cooperation with a Prussian consortium consisting of Bleichroder, Oppenheim, Rothschild, and the Disconto-Gesellschaft. Through Bismarck's intercession the king himself received Oppenheim, showing his interest in the
project and thereby putting pressure on reluctant cabinet members to approve
the exceptional features of the plan. A group of wealthy landowners led by
the governor-general of Posen, Count Konigsmarck, submitted a rival proposal, but financing did not materialize. Eventually the Prussian cabinet
yielded to Bismarck's coercive tactics. Thus arose the Preussische CentralBodeU'Credit-Aktiengesettschaft—a corporate bank, established under Bismarck's auspices, capitalized by bourgeois financiers, intended primarily to
serve rural landowners, and equipped with privileges that no similar institution could match.64
Amalgamating Elites
Bismarck's economic and social policy in the period after 1867 proceeded on
two levels: that of the Prussian and German governments, which, in collaboration with the Reichstag majority, opened the way for the final triumph of
industrial capitalism in Germany; and that of Bismarck's own intercessions in
economic affairs, which were mostly in the interest of artisans and landowners, particularly the latter.65 The two levels were interconnected. During the
1840s and 1850s agrarian exports from the eastern regions had provided foreign exchange that stimulated industrial growth. In the late 1860s the capital
generated by the German "takeoff" came, through Bismarck's mediation, to
the rescue of the eastern estate owners. The victory of Oppenheim's project
over Konigsmarck's would seem to demonstrate that Prussian agriculture,
even in its most prosperous period, could not produce sufficient capital to
generate a mortgage bank capable of seeing landowners through the agrarian
depressions of the future. Those bourgeois (and Jewish) bankers and financiers
of industry, whose services in financing the state debt were already indispensable to Prussia and other German governments, had now shown their value
to a gentry that had always regarded them with condescension.
Bismarck's persistent efforts in behalf of the material interests of the Prussian gentry at a time when many were becoming politically alienated reflect
his basic conviction, expressed at intervals throughout his career, that the
agrarian landowning class was the backbone of the state. In his personal relations, to be sure, he never discriminated, from all reports, between noblemen and bourgeois; he was in fact generally contemptuous of those whom he

suspected of demanding privilege by virtue of status rather than performance.
During the war of 1870-1871 he often expressed his outrage at those German
princes who cluttered up the German headquarters and made claims upon his
time without contributing to the war effort. In his choice of ministers and
subordinates the emphasis was less upon birth than upon talent, experience,
and capacity for subordination. The latter requirement may have inclined
him to seek bourgeois replacements for those aristocratic ministers of whose
incompetence and independence he so often complained in the 1860s. At
any rate Bodelschwingh, Selchow, Itzenplitz, Muhler, and Lippe were all replaced by commoners: Heydt, Camphausen, Hobrecht, Friedenthal, Achenbach, FaIk, and Leonhardt. Even the "reactionary cabinet" of the 1880s was
manned mostly by commoners: Bitter, Scholz, Boetticher, Gossler, Lucius,
Maybach, and Friedberg. Only Puttkamer and Botho Eulenburg belonged to
the old aristocracy. Two cabinet members—Friedenthal and Friedberg—were
of Jewish origin. Bismarck's social bias favored the gentry as a class, not as
individuals. It arose from the values and prejudices of the paternalistic tradition, with which he identified himself, and from the primary form in which
his own personal wealth was invested.
Bismarck's involvement with banks and bourses, bonds and shares, in managing his own fortune gave him a better appreciation of the achievements of
Prussian financiers and entrepreneurs and of their worth to the Prussian-German establishment. This appreciation can be seen in a previously unknown
memorandum of February 1868, in which Bismarck advised the king to give
an audience to three bourgeois benefactors who wished to found a "North
German Welfare Association." He argued that the proposal had a "social and
political importance" that transcended the objection that the new association
would duplicate the services of existing organizations patronized by the nobility. The proposal was, he said, the "first attempt" of the "bourgeois element"
to develop, without excluding aristocratic participation, an "independent"
strength in the area of charitable activity. Traditionally the HohenzoUem
monarchy had favored "certain social classes"; now the time had come to
encourage the bourgeois and noble estates to cooperate in Christian activities
like the Johanniter-Orden, hitherto a noble preserve. To rebuff the petitioners
would alienate "wide and influential circles." These circles offered the monarchy a social and political support (Hilfsmittel) equal to and "in numbers"
actually superior to that provided by the nobility. "Human nature, with
which we have to reckon on all sides, is the same in all social classes."66
In opposing the Reichstag's demand for emolument, Bismarck maintained
that membership in parliament must be limited to the "busy classes," by
which he meant landowners and businessmen sufficiently wealthy to spend
several months of the year on government business without reimbursement.

"Busy" was meant to exclude capitalists living off invested wealth without
managerial functions, but not absentee landowners living off the rent from
leased estates!67 His effort to involve wealthy bourgeois politically also influenced his plans for the reform of county government and the Prussian House
of Lords. The draft of a new Kreisordnung presented by Eulenburg's Ministry
of the Interior in September 1869 called for a county diet (Kreisrat) chosen
by three electoral bodies composed of big landowners, rural communes, and
towns. Bismarck advocated a fourth to consist of the biggest taxpayers. This
would have strengthened the gentry in those counties where they predominated, but would at the same time have given representation to residents
whose wealth, though not derived from landed estates, gave them "prominent
social importance." Both groups could be depended upon to support "order
and conservation."68
Increasing difficulties with the conservative gentry led Bismarck in the winter of 1872-1873 to the opinion that reform of the Prussian House of Lords
was even more pressing than that of county government. As established by
King Friedrich Wilhelm IV in 1855, the House of Lords was dominated overwhelmingly by landowning noblemen, many of whom had hereditary seats.
Prussia lacked, Bismarck believed, "a born, influential, big-landowning aristocracy in the English sense, among whom the king is the first peer." To function effectively, he believed, the upper chamber ought to be able to speak for
the "entire propertied class." It should represent "all people of property,
among whom I also count the millionaires." No distinction ought to be made,
furthermore, between bourgeois and noble landowners in determining the
gentry's representation, for bourgeois owners of estates "have become Junkers
themselves within a short time and joined the nobility." In addition to "an
electoral curia of millionaires" he proposed that mayors of the larger cities and
provincial governors ought to belong to the chamber.69 The House of Lords,
in other words, should mirror an enlarged Prussian establishment: aristocrats,
generals, gentry, state officials—and capitalists.
To this end Bismarck also approved the blending of the dominant elites
through intermarriage and ennoblement. "A little fresh blood will do your
family tree some good," the son of Wilhelmine Mencken advised an aristocratic general who was reluctant to permit his son to marry into a prosperous
bourgeois family.70 In 1883 he objected to attempts by the Prussian heraldry
office to preserve the exclusive character of the noble estate. The result, he
warned Wilhelm, would be to "heighten the contrast between members of
the aristocracy and those bourgeois circles that, in terms of education and
social position, stand on the same level with noblemen and that, like the

latter, supply the state with officers and higher officials. The strict exclusiveness of the German nobility in earlier times is what produced that hatred of
the aristocracy that was especially strong before the last great war and during
the conflict over military reform and that is today more in evidence and more
sharply expressed than it was ten years ago. The prestige of the English nobil­
ity is owed to its accessibility to those not born into it. The circumstances
that our nobility is much more numerous and poorer only speaks for the ne­
cessity of making it more accessible. A poor, numerous nobility invites bour­
geois envy more than a rich one and sharpens the irritation of those whose
requests for entry into this large estate are rejected. The factor of modest
wealth, which the Office of Heraldry uses for rejecting requests [for ennoble­
ment], has another side that speaks for acceptance rather than rejection. A
nobility of limited means is the nursery school for your majesty's officer corps.
To increase the number of young people who are largely compelled to choose
the officer corps as their profession is an advantage for the army. As Frederick
the Great complained in his time, the sons of rich noblemen go 'through the
army like a sieve'; that is, they retire young. By contrast the sons of poor
noblemen serve until pensioned."71 In 1888 Bismarck repeated his advice to
Friedrich III: "It is in the interest of the nobility to assimilate those individ­
uals whose wealth is in some degree permanently established."72
During the quarter century that followed the revolution of 1848 Bismarck
ceased to believe that big landowners and big businessmen, agrarianism and
industrialism, were natural enemies. He came to the conclusion that men of
means—whether of agrarian, commercial, industrial, or banking wealth—
had a common cause in preserving the fabric of society and government. They
were "the governed" whose mutual interest in "order and conservation"
should be institutionalized in the House of Lords and county diets and be
realized politically by the collaboration of conservative and moderate liberal
parties in the Reichstag and Chamber of Deputies in support of the govern­
ment. To that end he sought to reduce conflicts of interest between agrarian
and industrial capital and to promote the fusion of their social elites. While
the interests of landowners remained his primary concern, he promoted the
expansion of the economic and social foundation of the Prussian-German es­
tablishment to include the new men of property.

Nationalism and National Policy

INCE 1863 Bismarck had steadily mastered the idiom of national
patriotism in speeches, diplomatic dispatches, and other writings.
After 1866 he rewrote his personal history, depicting himself as a
German patriot whose aim as a statesman had always been to unify
Germany.1 Yet it would be wrong to conclude that his later expressions of
German national sentiment were purely tactical. The utterances were too
frequent and made in situations too varied to be explained away as political
cant. He too was warmed by the fire he helped to kindle. The problem is not
whether Bismarck was moved in these later years by German national sentiment, but by what kind. Did he conceive the German nation as an ethnic
and cultural entity, formed and animated by a Voi/csgeist? Or was the German
nation for him an entity shaped by the state and associated with its social and
political institutions? Was the German Reich a "nation-state" or "state-nation"?2
As used here, these terms identify two conflicting traditions in Germany.
' On Bismarck's national sentiment in earlier years see vol. 1, pp. 18-23 a n d 67—70. His
conscious adoption of German nationalistic language is evident in many documents of 18631866. In the draft of a diplomatic dispatch of May 21,1863, on the Schleswig-Holstein question,
for example, he inserted an inflammatory denunciation of "the system for the domination and
exploitation of Germans by Danes." Historische Reichskommission, Die ausuiartige Pohtik Preussens, 1858-1871 (Berlin, 1932-1939), V, no. 82. For other examples see Ausuiartige Poiitik Preussens, IV, nos. 340, 590; V, no. 106; Heinnch Ritter von Srbik, Quellen zur deutschen Politik

VII, 98-99; X, 196; BR, II, 170, 243, 368. Striking evidence of his newly acquired mastery of
the idiom of nationalism can be seen in his revision of the draft of Wilhelm's proclamation to
the German people in 1866. GW, V, 551-552.
* The analysis undertaken here does not aim at a typology of nationalisms as such—although
it clearly has implications for that subject—but of German nationalism in the nineteenth century. Underlying the analysis is a general assumption: that nations are not natural (or biological)
but historical and psychological phenomena. A nation is constituted when its inhabitants come
to believe in its existence. The form it takes is historically determined, that is, shaped by historical experiences (both cultural and political) and by popular conceptions of those experiences,
whether derived from folk memories and mythologies or from the works of the historians, philosophers, and literati who touch on and interpret those experiences. After a long hiatus, the study
of nationalism has undergone a resurgence of late in Germany. See Heinrich August Winkler,

* The Reich of Iron and Blood *

In the tradition of Herder, on the one hand, the nation is a spiritual force
creating the unique forms of cultural life that characterize and differentiate
peoples. After 1869 this tradition received a fresh impulse in the writings of
Richard Bockh. Bockh condemned the suppression of alien languages for political purposes as a "despiritualization of the population" and a "crime against
the spiritual order of peoples"; the task of civilization was to promote the
spiritual development of every ethnic nation. In the tradition of Hegel, on
the other hand, the state is the vessel of the Weltgeist and as such a divine
creation embodying morality—a conception that gave to the state a status
never before attributed to it in western political thought. Hegel himself never
invested the state with the power to produce ethnic homogeneity, but the
Hegelian tradition assumed new forms as Germany passed from the age of the
restoration to that of national unification. Divested of its metaphysical trappings, the state remained a Machtstaat in the era of Realpolitik. Earlier regarded
as the product of spirit, the state was now assumed to have the moral authority
to enforce conformity of spirit. In System der Staatslehre published in 1857
Constantin Rossler declared, "The ruling nationality has the right to denationalize by force when this can be carried out and when required for selfpreservation. It can also grant the enclaved alien peoples [Stdmme] a national
development insofar as this is not accompanied by political danger."3
The traditions of Herder (nation-state) and Hegel (state-nation) were both
alive in modified forms during the Bismarck period, but the German experience conformed more to the latter than the former. Although some German
historians have been prone to identify the Hegelian tradition exclusively with
liberalism,4 this is manifestly a distortion. It is true that liberals proved to be
intolerant of ethnic minorities in the German revolutions of 1848, but an
archconservative, Leopold von Gerlach, penned these lines in 1853: "The
task of a state is to increase the dominant part of its population and to diminish the subordinate part. Germanize the Poles, protestantize the Roman
Catholics."5 Heinrich von Treitschke detected two competing forces in history: "the tendency of every state to amalgamate its population in speech and
manners into one single mold"; and the impulse felt by every vigorous nationality to construct a state of its own.6 No sooner had the Hohenzollern monarchy achieved the latter for Germany than it undertook the former. Rightly

or wrongly, ethnic differences were believed to be a source of political instability. What the Russians attempted through Russification and Hungarians
through Magyarization, the Bismarck government sought to achieve through
Germanization. Religious strife in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
gave birth to the principle of cuius regio, eius religio; national strife in the
nineteenth century to that of cuius regio, eius natio.

Bismarck was not given to abstractions and did not speak or write with the
precision expected of a historian, philosopher, or social scientist when using
the terms "nation" or "national." Yet one can ascertain from the context in
which he repeatedly used these terms how he conceived them. W h e n the
occasion demanded, he spoke the idiom of German idealism. In December
1870, for example, he told the Austrians that the movement for German
unification was "a development stemming from the history and spirit of the
German people" and hence beyond his control. 7 But such utterances were
infrequent. More often Bismarck referred to the nation as closely associated
with the state. Hence he still spoke on occasion of the "Prussian nation,"
"Prussian nationality," and even "north German nationality." 8 The German
nation had concrete existence for him only when united under a sovereign
state. During 1866-1867 he is said to have often remarked, "My highest ambition is to make the Germans into a nation." 9 The "establishment of the
German nationality" is how he sometimes described his life's work. IO By the
"German nation," a term that Bismarck used after 1871, he meant the German Reich, not the German-speaking people of Europe.
"I was born a Junker, but my policy was not that of the Junkers," Bismarck
told Moritz Busch in 1881. "I am above all a royalist, then a Prussian and a
German. I will defend my king and the monarchy against revolution, both
overt and covert, and I will establish and leave behind me a strong and
healthy Germany." 11 He was able to make the transition from Prussian to
German patriotism in the 1860s because the German union he brought about
preserved the essential values he treasured in Prussian society and government. I2
The Germans, Bismarck often lamented, had a poorly developed national
consciousness in comparison with other peoples. They venerated foreign cultures and institutions and emulated other nations at the cost of their own. As

emigrants they were quick to shed their ethnic identity and as subjects of
foreign rulers all too ready to establish new loyalties. "The inclination to become enthusiastic for alien nationalities and national aspirations—including
those that can only be realized at the cost of one's own country is a political
disease whose geographical spread is unfortunately limited to Germany."13 An
invading army, he predicted in the late 1860s, would not meet the kind of
determined resistance in Germany that could perhaps be expected in every
other closed (geschlossen) European nation. "Undoubtedly there is . . . something in our national character that resists the unification of Germany."14
German attachments tended to be particularistic—to dynasty, Stamm, region,
party, and faction rather than to the nation as a whole. These peculiarities
explained why Alsace-Lorraine could have been absorbed into France during
the preceding two centuries, why Germany had lost its unity in the Middle
Ages, and why its reunification had taken so long. But they also explained
the vigor of party politics in the Reichstag and the unwillingness of its majority at times to accept Bismarck's conception of what was good for the country. 1 '
Bismarck hoped that the national patriotism generated on the battlefield
in two wars fought for the goal of national unity would overcome these defects
in Germany's "national character." The force of national sentiment, earlier
so useful for the external expansion of Prussia, had now to be capped and
turned inward to solidify the structure he had created. From 1867 onward it
was a principal means by which he sought to reconcile the populations of the
states annexed by Prussia and to integrate the remaining states, their governments and peoples, into the federal system of the North German Confederation and the German Reich. By word and deed he sought to convey the impression that the new Germany was not merely an extension of the Prussian
Machtstaat, to which the citizenry owed mere formal obedience, but also an
organic national state requiring their patriotic allegiance.
This tactic, largely successful in one direction, created new problems in
another. The stress placed on the national character of the German Reich did
help to overcome particularistic loyalties, but it also served to estrange further
those ethnic minorities that lived within the empire's borders. The ethnic
conception that helped to reconcile Hanoverians, Saxons, Bavarians, Swabians, and other German Stdmme to the rule of Berlin could only heighten
the sense of alienation felt by Poles, Danes, and Frenchmen who demanded
for themselves the same right of ethnic self-determination claimed by Germans. Bismarck's tactical use of German nationalism as a moral reinforcement for a Reich created by Prussian power politics frustrated the political

assimilation of the empire's ethnic minorities and thereby endangered the
security of its frontiers. The only practical escape from this dilemma appeared
to be their Germanization. Greater ethnic homogeneity, it seemed, was a
precondition for the final consolidation of the German Reich.

The Annexed Population of 1866
By annexing the principalities of Hanover, Hesse-Kassel, Nassau, SchleswigHolstein and the city of Frankfurt, Prussia added 4,300,000 inhabitants to its
previous population of 19,501,723.16 Earlier it was shown that Bismarck preferred complete to partial annexation in the belief that the rulers of the principalities, if left any fragment of their former territories, would become the
focus of irredentist movements hazardous to the integration of the annexed
territories into Prussia. In view of the later behavior of the Guelph dynasty of
Hanover, this may have been a realistic decision. Yet the liquidation of so
many thrones and sovereignties increased the resentment of many of the annexed, who now began to describe themselves as "must-Prussians."
As was to be expected, the difficulties encountered were roughly proportionate to the size of the population incorporated. In Nassau (population:
468,311) the problem was minimal. Assured of his property and income
(treaty of September 18, 1867), Duke Adolf released his officials and soldiers
from their oaths of allegiance. While he did not formally renounce the
throne, the duke made no attempt to reassert his sovereignty and in 1890
found compensation for his loss when he succeeded to the throne of the grand
duchy of Luxemburg. The citizens of Frankfurt (population: 90,800) were resentful, but helpless. The liquidation of military rule and cancellation of a
huge "war indemnity" (imposed despite the fact that the city had not declared
war) eased the transition. Hesse-Kassel (population: 763,200) was a more difficult problem. Captured early in the fighting and imprisoned at Stettin, the
Elector Friedrich Wilhelm refused to settle with his conquerors. Although he
signed a treaty (September 17, 1867) similar to that imposed on the Duke of
Nassau, he reasserted his sovereignty in 1868 and suffered impoundment of
his properties and income. Before the deposed elector's death in 1875, however, his heir had already come to terms with the Prussian government, recognizing the annexation as irrevocable. Persistent misgovernment before
1866 had in any case made the dynasty unpopular among Hessians; the German national and pro-Prussian movement was strong in the electorate as a
consequence. Yet some inhabitants objected to the "hardness, discipline, and
sobriety of the east German style," and aristocratic conservatives were reluctant to part with rights that the dynasty had sheltered; Lutherans feared the

loss of religious autonomy. Nevertheless, the opposition of the die-hard minority, if vocal, was relatively ineffective.17
The inhabitants of Schleswig-Holstein (population: 1,028,600) were divided between a "Prussian party" favoring annexation and an "Augustenburg
party" opposing it. The latter had the support of a large majority of voters,
including progressives and national liberals. They were disappointed when
the National Liberal party in the Reichstag decided that the claims of Prince
Friedrich of Augustenburg, while legitimate, must give way before "the eternal right of the future of the German people." Prince Friedrich reserved his
claims, but took no action, recognizing that Prussia's victory over Austria had
ended his last hope. Before dying in 1880 he had the consolation of seeing his
daughter affianced to Prince Wilhelm of Prussia. His would-be subjects were
less easily appeased. Two generations of Schleswig-Holsteiners had fought for
independence; resentments against Denmark now became resentments
against Prussia. The problem was exacerbated by the heavy-handedness of the
Prussian bureaucracy, which imposed Prussian laws and taxes with little regard for native traditions and interests, in part against Bismarck's wishes. During the 1870s the region's farmers protested by voting for social democratic
candidates to the Reichstag. Schleswig-Holstein became, after Saxony, the
second most important stronghold of the social democrats in Germany. Its
inhabitants were little reconciled by Wilhelm's declaration that "Germany
alone has profited from what Prussia has gained." In 1888 the provincial governor admitted sadly that in twenty years little had been achieved for the
"spiritual and political union of the province to Prussia."18
The most difficult problem of assimilation was Hanover (population:
1,933,800). A devout believer in divine right, King Georg V of the Guelph
dynasty, Germany's oldest, steadfastly refused to accept his fate. From exile
in Austria this proud and stubborn descendant of Henry the Lion denounced
annexation as "criminal and detestable robbery" and a "flagrant violation" of
international law. While releasing his officials and officers from their oath of
allegiance, he refused to surrender the possibility of ultimate restoration and
conspired to hasten the day of his return. He hoped for diplomatic support
from relatives among Europe's leading dynasties, particularly Britain. But he
also relied on popular support from those segments of Hanoverian society
which out of sentiment or self-interest hoped for a restoration: the nobility,
dependent primarily on the Hanoverian state for political power and income

(noble estates constituted only 6.5 percent of all land in Lower Saxony); officials and army officers, whose careers were jeopardized by annexation; residents of the capital city who had profited from a free-spending court; peasants
and artisans, whose interests had been favored by the anti-industrial policies
of the old regime; men of military age who dreaded the longer and more vigorous Prussian military service; Lutherans, who feared incorporation into the
Prussian Evangelical church; and Catholics, who objected to national unity
under a Protestant dynasty.
Yet the irreconcilable "Guelphs" were opposed by a majority of Hanoverians who did accept Prussian annexation: members of the business and professional classes whose interests were served by national unity; liberals, who detested the autocratic ways of King Georg; and German patriots, whose
enthusiasm for national unity outweighed dread of "Prussianization." Many
urban workers—politically uncommitted, impoverished by the disruption
caused by mobilization and war, and suspicious of their pro-annexationist employers^—were initially anti-Prussian, but they had no attachment to the
Guelph dynasty and no interest in the preservation of particularism in itself.
In the first national election held in Hanover (February 1867) 144,188 voters
cast their ballots for pro-annexation candidates, 129,885 for Guelph particularists. From 1871 to 1890 four to eleven Guelph deputies sat in the German
Reichstag; the Guelph particularists generally commanded about 30 percent
of the Hanoverian electorate.19
From the outset Bismarck recognized that Hanover would be "hard to swallow"; its annexation was a "risk" that had to be taken.20 The size of the opposition appeared formidable, particularly when coupled with overt acts of
resistance. In April and May 1867 the Luxemburg crisis raised the prospect of
war with France and infused the Guelph movement with fresh hope. Several
hundred men, mostly ex-soldiers in the Hanoverian army, crossed the border
into the Netherlands and Switzerland to form a "Guelph legion." Equipped
with American passports, they migrated in January 1868 to France, where
they were quartered for a time in Alsace. Financed by King Georg, they remained in France for more than two years, despite Bismarck's remonstrances
to the French government. Georg estimated their strength at approximately
800 men, Bismarck at 1,400.21

of income independent of parliamentary control that was highly useful in ma" Ernst Pitz, "Deutschland und Hannover im Jahre 1866," Niedersachisches ]ahrbuch fur Landesgeschichte, 38 (1966), pp. 86-158; Werner Leffler, Ursachen und Anfange der deutsch-hannoverschen (welfischen) Bewegung (Wismar, 1932), pp. 23-43; Stewart A.

nipulating public opinion at home and abroad throughout the rest of his career. In November 1866 he impounded all funds and properties of the Guelph
dynasty and then opened negotiations with the monarch in Vienna through
a former Hanoverian minister, Ludwig Windthorst, future leader of the German Center party. For the return of 19 million thalers in public funds that
Georg had shipped to Britain before the outbreak of hostilities Bismarck offered the income from 16 million thalers invested in Prussian state bonds and
other securities and the income from certain Guelph properties (the domains
of Calenberg), which were to remain under Prussian administration pending
Georg's formal abdication.22 While he had no intention of abdicating, Georg
agreed to this settlement, and Bismarck gained its approval by the Prussian
Landtag after considerable difficulty. On the day of final passage (February 18,
1868), however, the king celebrated his silver wedding anniversary in Hietzing, a suburb of Vienna, with a public toast calling upon God to restore his
throne and Hanover's independence.23 Within a few days fresh reports of the
activities of the Guelph legion and of Georg's connections with it arrived in
Berlin. Bismarck reacted by sequestering Georg's property once more under
the emergency clause of the Prussian constitution, declaring that the income
would be used to counteract Guelph subversion. This action, which was approved by the Prussian Landtag in February 1869, gave birth to the famous
"Guelph fund" (dubbed "reptile fund" by liberal critics).24
Prussian espionage, financed by the fund, soon penetrated the Guelphs so
thoroughly that Bismarck boasted he could find out, if he wished, what Georg
ate for breakfast every morning.25 In February 1870 the drying up of his financial resources compelled the king to disband the legion, only five months
before the war against France. Napoleon's defeat settled the fate of the
Guelph movement, but it did not end the determination of the Guelph family
to recover the lost crown. On Georg's death in 1878 his heir, Ernst August,
reasserted his claims to Hanover; in 1884 he also claimed the succession to
Brunswick on the death of the reigning duke. Not until 1892, after Bismarck
was gone and a new Kaiser sat on the German throne, did Ernst August, by
committing himself never to engage in hostile action against the Reich, secure the release of the property and income promised in 1868. For more than
two decades the obstinacy of the Guelph family and the compliance of the
Prussian Landtag permitted Bismarck to draw upon a secret fund (whose annual income came to more than a million marks), uncontrolled by parliament
or any other government agency. The use he made of the fund extended far

beyond the annexed regions and the Guelph problem. With it he built up an
espionage network, bought up journalists and newspapers, subsidized public
projects, assisted colleagues in financial distress, rewarded "friends of the
state," bribed the King of Bavaria and the equerry to accept national unity,
and eased the conclusion of the Kulturkampf by pensioning bishops and bribing a cardinal.26
Negotiations with former rulers were a matter of foreign policy and hence
under Bismarck's direct control. For implementation of government policy in
all other matters (such as civil and military administration, the judiciary, finance, church affairs) he was dependent upon the cooperation of his colleagues in the Prussian cabinet, particularly Count Eulenburg, minister of interior. At the first sign of resistance in Hanover in late July 1866 Bismarck
secured the appointment of a military governor, General Konstantin von
Voigts-Rhetz, who was instructed to make inhabitants "feel" the Prussian occupation, thereby encouraging Prussia's friends and frightening its enemies.
"Every act of real resistance must be suppressed and punished without leniency." "Wo nicht Liebe sein will, Furcht sein muss." Anti-Prussian newspapers
were censored or suppressed; recruiters for the Guelph legion were arrested,
tried, and imprisoned. Bismarck urged that towns and regions where acts of
resistance occurred be fined; indignities suffered by the occupation troops
should be severely punished; recalcitrant policemen, officials, and judges
should be "purged"; Hanoverian officials should be transferred to Prussia and
Prussian officials to Hanover.27 Yet Bismarck was dissatisfied with the results.
In May 1867 he warned Eulenburg that he did not intend to "assume the

responsibility before his majesty for the continuance of the present situation."
He complained of "passive resistance" and threatened to disavow all respon­
sibility before the Landtag and Reichstag. Eulenburg, he declared, had tried
too hard to spare the Hanoverian nobility or "feudal party"; he ought to have
proceeded "much more radically" in Hanover, like Austria had in Bohemia
28
after her triumph in 1620 at the Battle of White Mountain.
In other respects, however, Bismarck believed that his colleagues pro­
ceeded much too fast and "too sharply" in integrating Hanover into Prussia.
In August 1866 he opposed "Prussianization" of Hanover. Except for intro­
duction of Prussia's military system, "uniformity was to be avoided," and the
"individuality" of Hanover respected; Germany had to be shown that "Prussia
has the capacity to absorb, without liquidating, all German individualities."
To this end he promised that Prussia would carry out the incorporation in
consultation with prominent citizens of the new provinces.29 Yet Eulenburg,
Count Lippe (minister of justice), and von der Heydt (minister of finance)
were opposed to such consultations, and it was not until June 1867 that Bis­
marck forced the Prussian cabinet to accept his point of view. A few days
later, after Bismarck had departed for rest and recuperation at Varzin, the
ministers reversed themselves. They succeeded in getting the approval of WiIhelm, who was unaware of Bismarck's objections, to a flood of unifying ordi­
nances: the introduction of Prussian codes of criminal law and procedure; the
subordination of the judiciary to a superior court of appeals in Berlin; intro­
duction of the Prussian stamp tax; abolition of state lotteries in Hanover,
Osnabriick, and Frankfurt; the establishment of administrative control by the
Prussian state treasury over the capital wealth (chiefly domain funds and trea­
sury surpluses) of the annexed lands. These measures, particularly the latter,
shocked and angered even the pro-Prussian and German-national segment of
the annexed population. Rudolf von Bennigsen and Count Munster, leaders
of the National Liberal and Free Conservative parties, uttered sharp pro­
tests. 3°
Back of the dispute between Bismarck and his colleagues was a greater is­
sue. Eulenburg, Lippe, and Heydt wished to perpetuate the centralized, bu­
reaucratic machinery of the Prussian state, while Bismarck favored greater
local autonomy through the extension of "self-administration." By preserving
the "individuality" of the annexed state, he hoped to establish a pattern for
later reorganization of provincial and local government in the rest of Prussia.
Once again Wilhelm's trust enabled Bismarck to get the upper hand. Breaking
off his vacation in Varzin, Bismarck met the king at Bad Ems, and, when they

parted, the rumor spread that the dismissals of Eulenburg and Lippe were imminent, but only Lippe resigned. Some financial measures were reversed and
consultations were held with Vertrauensmdnner from all of the annexed
lands.31 In September 1867, as the "transitional year" provided for in the
statute of annexation came to a close, Bismarck pushed through the appointment of his own candidate, Count Otto zu Stolberg-Wernigerode, for the
position of Oberprdsident of the province of Hanover. Stolberg was young
(thirty years old) and, as the owner of estates in Hanover, not alien to the
region. He was more acceptable to the natives than the kind of "old Prussian"
administrator whom Eulenburg preferred. Furthermore, he was Bismarck's
man. The chancellor communicated with him directly, over the heads of
Heydt and Eulenburg, although he was technically Eulenburg's subordinate.32
Stolberg governed as Bismarck directed. In conformity with the wishes of
the Vertrauensmdnner, a provincial diet was established for the former kingdom of Hanover. At its first session the diet passed unanimously a motion
introduced by Rudolf von Bennigsen calling for transfer of administrative
control over the Hanoverian domain fund (amounting to approximately 16
million thalers) from the Prussian treasury to the new provincial government.
Bismarck, who had instructed Stolberg to treat the proposal benevolently,
now insisted over the objections of Heydt that the Prussian cabinet present
the diet's proposal to the Prussian Landtag in the form of a bill. His purpose
was not only to appease Hanoverians, whose taxes had increased 20 percent
after annexation, but to establish by law a precedent for greater provincial
self-administration throughout Prussia.33 During 1868 this bill aroused considerable heat in the Prussian House of Lords and Chamber of Deputies. Conservatives were angered by the government's generosity toward the defeated,
and they resented the prospect that Hanover, through the possession of its
own "provincial fund," would have a better financial status than the old provinces of Prussia. Ultimately the bill passed the Chamber of Deputies by a close
vote (197 to 192) over the combined opposition of conservatives and progressives. Even this slim majority had to be purchased by inclusion of an
amendment that replaced the fund with an annual grant of five hundred thou3' Horst Kohl, ed., Bismarck-Jahrbuch (Leipzig, 1898), V, 189-192; GW, Via, 11-14, 52, 385386; VII, 215; Horst Kohl, ed., Anhang zu den Gedanken una Ennnerungen von Otto Furst von

sand thalers from the Prussian treasury, an amount nearly equivalent to its
income.34
For many years Bismarck followed closely the developments in Hanover
and the other annexed regions and often intervened in their administration.35
His treatment of the annexed states illustrates again his use of the classic
technique of the iron hand in velvet glove. Prussia's new subjects, he maintained, could best be assimilated by stressing that their independence had
been sacrificed for German national unity rather than for Prussian aggrandizement. In two private instructions of February 1870 to Stolberg he described
the essence of his assimilation policy. "The decisive factor which the governmental press will have to stress in its efforts to conquer particularistic attitudes
lies in the German and not in the Prussian nationality. By the latter expression we Prussians are accustomed to represent the former [!], but it is not the
ideal under which we shall succeed in making acceptable to our new countrymen the position that we attained in 1866." The journalists of the subsidized
press, he directed, should stress the common lower Saxon tribal background
of the Brandenburg and Hanoverian peoples, their joint struggle for the Lutheran religion in the Thirty Years War, and their comradeship in arms during
the Seven Years War. In particular, the emphasis must be on their common
German nationality and their "common national tasks and interests."36
Bismarck did not rely on German nationalism alone to bind Prussia's new
subjects to Berlin. Under his prodding the Prussian government promoted
economic growth in the annexed areas, particularly through railway construction. Money from the Guelph fund flowed into a host of material and cultural
projects: new facilities at the seashore resort of Norderney, road construction,
a new church for Hildesheim, four new teaching positions at the University
of Gottingen, subsidies for schools and museums.37 While this largesse probably had an effect, diehard Guelph particularists remained a problem. During
the early stages of the war of 1870-1871 Bismarck worried that the French
might land on the North Sea coast and foment rebellion in Hanover.38 In the
election of 1878 the Guelph party scored an unexpected success, increasing
its Reichstag representation from four to ten deputies. During the runoff election of that year riots (described by a resident as "American conditions")

broke out in the Elbe port of Harburg. Again Bismarck sought repressive measures, including martial law.39 In 1880 Wilhelm also concluded that the government had been too tolerant of Guelph agitation, which he believed to be
on the increase.40 In the election of 1887 Guelph popularity at the polls
reached a peak under the Reich at 113,000 votes. To the end of the empire,
long after the generation of 1866 was gone and Bismarck as well, the Guelphs
remained a small but persistent thorn in the empire's flesh.

The "Polish Problem"
Of the Prussian population of 18,491,220 in 1861, 14 percent was non-German. The Polish minority, numbering 2,265,042, was by far the largest, followed by 139,428 Lithuanians, 83,443 Wends, and 59,850 Czechs. In the
province of Posen the Poles were a majority, constituting 55 percent of the
provincial population; but they were also strong in the province of West Prussia (32 percent) and in the district of Oppeln (59 percent) in Upper Silesia.41
Initially leadership of the Polish national movement was in the hands of Polish gentry and clergy; Prussian officals, including Bismarck, continued to regard these groups as the main source of the "Polish problem" long after this
was no longer true.42 Prussia's abolition of manorialism, encouragement of
free enterprise, construction of roads and railways, and improvement in public education speeded the growth of a new Polish middle class and intelligentsia that joined and eventually superseded the clergy and gentry in promoting
the cause of Polish nationalism. During the 1850s and 1860s Polish voters
sent as many as twenty-six representatives to the Prussian Chamber of Deputies. In 1867 they elected eleven deputies to the Reichstag. Between 1871
and 1890 the Polish caucus in the Reichstag held from thirteen to eighteen
seats.43 In both chambers the Poles were a persistently dissident group and
enthusiastic participants in antigovernment coalitions.
Before 1870 Prussian policy toward its Polish minority had fluctuated between toleration and repression. Four times the Poles rose against alien rule:
1830-1831, 1846, 1848, and 1863. Although Russia was the chief target of
these insurrections, Prussia felt threatened. In the 1830s Eduard von Flottwell, governor-general of Posen, inaugurated a policy of Germanization. By

tionships" through the Polish masses, he hoped to achieve "the complete
union of both nationalities." Flottwell's program was ended by Friedrich WiIhelm IV on his succession to the throne in 1840. But the rebellions at the
end of the decade liquidated the king's policy of toleration.44 Eugen von Puttkamer, governor-general of Posen in the 1850s, strove to keep the Poles "in
the subordinate position that is their due." They were enemies who could not
be reconciled, but whose extermination would be inhuman and impossible—
"at least it would take generations."45 His successor, Carl von Horn, governor-general from 1862 to 1869, began by declaring that Prussia would respect
the language, religion, and mores of the Poles, although they would have to
learn German as a second tongue. After the rebellion of Russia's Poles in 1863
he changed his tone. "The province will be Germanized in the sense that it
will become predominately German and that the Poles who dwell there—
even if they keep their nationality and language, as have the Lithuanians and
Masurians in East Prussia—do not think any more about rebellion and separation.""6 But Horn was handicapped in his attempt to resurrect Flottwell's
policies by Bismarck's need in 1866-1870 to remain on good terms with the
Catholic church in order not to alienate south German Catholics. When
Horn came into conflict with Archbishop Ledochowski of Posen-Gnesen, he
was removed from his post.47
Horn's departure did not mean that Bismarck was insensitive to the "Polish
problem." A few months later he complained to the king—an extraordinary
step—about the ineffectiveness of the assimilation policies of his colleagues,
Minister of Interior Eulenburg and Kultusminister Miihler. On the basis of police reports, he charged that the Polish tongue was making inroads on the
German, because elementary schools in Polish-speaking regions had failed to
offer the instruction in German mandated by a Prussian ordinance of November 1865. The ordinance had foundered on the resistance of Polish clergymen
acting as school inspectors.48 This document signals the beginning of what

eventually became the Kulturkampf against the Catholic church. Polish conduct during the war of 1870-1871 reinforced Bismarck's sense of urgency concerning the problem of assimilation. From the provincial government of Posen came alarming reports of Polish disaffection: open partisanship for France;
the incitement of Polish army reservists to desert; hostile demonstrations at
German victory celebrations; widespread anger at the Versailles proclamation
establishing the "German Empire"; and evidence of a subversive organization.
"No one who is acquainted with the conditions here can doubt that the hearts
of the Polish population are on the whole dedicated to the cause of France in
the war that has broken out." Several battalions of Silesian militia and a reserve regiment of the regular army had to be quartered in the province to
preserve order.49
In cabinet meetings on October 13 and November 1, 1871, Bismarck insisted that the time had come to counterattack. "From the Russian border to
the Adriatic Sea we are confronted with Slavic propaganda combined with
that of ultramontanes and reactionaries, and it is necessary openly to defend
our national interests and our language against such hostile activities. . . .
Everywhere in Europe Slavs and Latins [Rorrumen], in alliance with ultramontanism, seek to preserve crudity and ignorance and fight Germanism, which
endeavors to spread enlightenment. . . . For a long time it has been observed
that in Polish-Catholic regions of the monarchy the Germanizing task of the
elementary schools is pushed into the background, instruction in German is
neglected, and at the same time the area where Polish is spoken grows."50
Hounded by Bismarck, Kultusminister Miihler drafted what became the school
inspection act of March n , 1872, which made explicit the government's
power to appoint and dismiss school inspectors.51 The targets of this statute
were eighty-six archpriests who supervised the priests functioning as school
inspectors in 2,481 Catholic schools in Posen, Upper Silesia, and West Prussia. The government's purpose was to replace these unpaid officials with
twenty-five to thirty new, full-time, salaried professional school inspectors.52
With the passage of this statute the Kulturkampf (see chapter seven) began
in earnest. After unification had been completed Bismarck no longer had to
be gingerly in handling Catholic interests, either in Posen or in Germany.

The Kulturkampf had many roots, but the tap root, was, as Bismarck always
insisted,53 the Polish problem.
Although Adalbert FaIk, who replaced Miihler as Kultusminister in January
1872, made effective use of his power under the new statute, Bismarck was
still dissatisfied with the government's effort to stem the tide of Polonization.
In February 1872 he addressed a harsh letter to Minister of Interior Eulenburg,
deploring the minister's "passivity with regard to Polish conditions. . . . I
have the feeling that the ground under us in our Polish provinces, if not obviously crumbling at the moment, has been so undermined that it can collapse
as soon as a Polish-Catholic-Austrian policy develops in foreign affairs."
Should the minister and his subordinates fail to become "more active and
independent" in devising "preventive measures," someone would have to resign—either Eulenburg or himself.54 Six weeks later, Eulenburg, in explaining
to the Prussian Chamber of Deputies why Posen was to be excepted from a
new statute granting provincial self-administration, said bluntly, "We must
work to the end that the Poles become, first, Prussian and, then, German,
but Prussian and German they must become."55
During 1872-1873 a series of royal rescripts began the Germanization of
the schools in the eastern region. While these orders varied according to regional differences, the basic instruction was everywhere the same: henceforth
German was to be the language of instruction in elementary schools in all
subjects except religion. In Silesia and Prussia religion could be taught to
Polish and Lithuanian children in their mother tongues on the lower level
(first two years), but German was obligatory on the two higher levels (three
years each) except where "help" was needed to communicate. The rescript
for Posen, which came straight from the king, permitted religious instruction
in the Polish tongue on the upper levels as well, but only until the pupils
could comprehend German. Polish remained a subject of instruction for Polish children: in Posen, five hours weekly on the lower level, three hours
weekly on the middle and upper levels (even this could be abolished in "suitable situations" on order of the district government); in Prussia, only on the
upper level; in Silesia, on the upper level only on special permission by the

GW, XIV, 827. Bismarck's alarm was fueled by reports from secret agents. One report enclosed a letter purported to have been written from Zurich by a "well-known agent" of the "Polish
National Government" to the editor of a Polish newspaper in Posen, stating that the time for
armed insurrection was at hand for the Poles in collaboration with dissident Catholics and socialists. The "Catholic party" would at the "decisive moment" offer the German imperial crown
to the Habsburg Kaiser. Bismarck sent the document to Eulenburg with the comment that the
content, while "fantastic," deserved "attention." Constabel, ed. Vorgeschicfite des Kulturkampfes,
pp. 179-180. For other indications of Bismarck's alarm see Busch, TagebuchbUitter, II, 225, 280290, 307-308, 327, 361-362.

authorities. Schools whose pupils were 25 percent German speaking were to
be considered "pure German"; in such cases no alien tongues would be used.56
Although issued by the provincial governments, these rescripts were discussed and approved by the cabinet, including Bismarck. The king approved
the order on Posen only after the cabinet had quieted his doubts about its
pedagogical difficulties.57 Actually these bureaucratic decisions showed little
regard for the pedagogical problems involved in teaching pupils who knew no
German and lacked the desire or talent—or both—for learning it. The incentive of the teachers was spurred by a grant from the king's disposition fund of
5,000 thalers to be distributed among teachers who had "vigorously and successfully" promoted the German language among their pupils.58 Where methods were concerned, teachers received only minimal help from the authorities
(summer courses given at teacher training institutes in 1874). They were advised to "attack the matter freely and freshly" by speaking German in the
classroom from the first day.59 Polish citizens complained that their children
were no longer learning the basic skills of reading, writing, and arithmetic,
but their petitions to the Landtag were coldly dismissed with the advice that
"a German education is identical with education as such."60
Simultaneously with the attack on the Polish language in the schools the
government moved forward with a proposal for its abolition in the state administration, the judiciary, and public affairs in general. In 1870, Count Konigsmarck, governor-general of Posen, had justified the policy. If Posen was
to be "amalgamated with the rest of the monarchy," he wrote, some way had
to be found to breach the "isolation" of the Polish masses from German culture. On a lower cultural and economic plane than the Germans, they were
in danger of being "completely dispossessed and extirpated." By accepting
German culture, on the other hand, they had the prospect of "regenerating
themselves and fusing their individuality [Eigeruxrt] with that of the Germans." The aim, Konigsmarck claimed, was not "suppression of the Polish
nationality," but its "greatest possible reconciliation" with the German. If
German were made the only language of justice and government throughout
the Prussian monarchy, the Poles and Danes would feel the "compulsion" to

learn it. Drafted in 1872, the language of government act (Geschdftssprachengesetz) was delayed until 1876 by discussions within the Prussian government and by parliamentary procedure.62 The statute made German the language to be used for official business by all Prussian officials, agencies, and
political bodies. For a maximum of twenty years (permission granted at fiveyear intervals) minority tongues might be used "in addition to German" in
the oral proceedings and minutes of school boards, county diets, village councils and assemblies, and local courts.63 The measure was justified, the cabinet
explained to the king, because German had been taught for fifty years; "the
use of the Polish tongue in house and family, at work and while socializing,
in church and at religious services, in the press and literature would be completely undisturbed."64

Bismarck's Views on "Germanization"
Historians eager to protect Bismarck's reputation assumed that the concept of
"Germanization" was so alien to his thoughts that he could never have used
that term.65 But documents already in print when this Bismarck orthodoxy
flourished contradict this view. Two examples from the early period of his
presidency show the close connection in his mind between material bonds,
national sentiment, and political loyalty. In January 1865 he supported a proposal conceived by Gerson Bleichroder for a land bank in Posen on the
grounds that the plan "promised to be of great importance for the gradual
Germanization of the grand duchy of Posen, which is for political reasons so
desirable." In 1866 he pressed for construction of new rail links with Posen as
the quickest and surest way to impregnate "German culture and with it German sentiment."66 Numerous unpublished documents in the German and

Prussian archives, furthermore, show that the word "Germanization" was
fairly common in Bismarck's thoughts. For more than twenty years he was the
driving force behind the effort to Germanize the Poles.
The actual problem is not whether he used the term, but what he meant
by it. Germanization in the form of closer economic ties did not necessarily
mean ethnic assimilation. The survival of the East Prussian Masurians and
Lithuanians showed that the impregnation of German culture and German
sentiment need not deprive minorities of their native tongues.6' That Bismarck used the terms "Germanization" and "re-Germanization" with regard
to the Alsatians reinforces the point; it was their loyalty he needed, not their
language, which was already German. As a young man, moreover, Bismarck
had gone to the trouble of studying Polish, perhaps intrigued by the Polish
peasants (Kaschuben) whom he encountered in Pomerania. In 1870 he could
still muster enough of the language to attempt conversation with wounded
Polish soldiers. He attempted to persuade Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm
to learn Polish and to have it taught to the future Wilhelm II, asserting that
the Great Elector had spoken Polish, as had his successors before Frederick
the Great. But the heir to the throne refused, expressing distaste for both
people and language ("They must learn German").68
To patriotic Poles inclusion in a united Germany was a shocking contradiction. "We find ourselves in a peculiar situation during the proceedings in this
chamber," one of their spokesmen told the Reichstag, "when words resound
in our ears about the German past, about German mores and customs, about
the welfare of the German people. Not that we begrudge the German people
their welfare or want to impede their future. But what for you may be a common bond—this past, these mores and customs, this future—is for us more an
element of separation vis-a-vis yourselves." Bismarck had once spoken, he
continued, of the "right of a nation to exist, to breathe, and to unite." The
"divine and inalienable right" that Germans demanded for themselves they
should grant to others.69 To such an argument Bismarck had a standard reply.
"The gentlemen belong to no other state and to no other people than to
Bismarck used the word "Germanized" see: GW, VIc1 329 (fh.); AWB, I, 340-341; Lucius,
Bismarck-Erinnerungen, p. 338. How Rothfels, who knew the published Bismarck sources well,
could have overlooked these passages is mystifying. He knew of only two instances recorded in
1863 and 1876 in which Bismarck was reputed to have used the word "Germanization," but he
dismissed the first as "unbelievable"; the second, as "isolated." See his Bismarck,- Der Osten, una
das Reich, pp. 80-81 (fh.). As the references in this chapter show, the word and the purpose were
commonplace in the deliberations of the Prussian cabinet and ministries (Bismarck included),
particularly during the 1880s.

Prussia, to which I also belong." He denied that Polish deputies had any mandate to speak for the Polish-speaking population of Prussia. "Your countrymen
[Landskute] fought with the same courage and with the same devotion to the
cause that united us here as did the inhabitants of every other part of Prussia.
The countrymen, whom you represent here, are just as thankful for the blessings of Prussian culture as are the inhabitants of Silesia and other provinces."70
To attain his objectives simultaneously with Germans and Poles, Bismarck
had to talk out of both sides of his mouth. To the former he spoke of German
nationalism; to the latter, of Prussian patriotism. Before 1866 it had been
possible to see Prussia as a state-nation transcending ethnic differences. Now
the claim was incongruous. From the moment in April 1866 when he
launched Prussia on a course leading to the creation of a German nationstate, there was no longer any force to Bismarck's contention that the king of
Prussia had the same claim on the loyalty of his Polish as on that of his German subjects. If assimilation of the Poles was attainable at all, it could only
be through Germanization in the full ethnic sense of the term. The statenation had to be converted into a nation-state.
Bismarck always contended that his Polish policy was entirely defensive.
For ten years, he wrote in 1872, the Poles had made progress in their effort to
"undermine the foundations of the Prussian state." "We do not wish to extirpate Polish culture [Pole.nth.um]; we wish instead to defend German culture
[Deutschthum]frombeing extirpated." Whole villages in Posen, West Prussia,
and Upper Silesia, he maintained, had become Polonized, families with German names no longer spoke the tongue of their ancestors.7I Prussia's task was
to deprive Polish peasants and workers of pastoral and aristocratic leadership
and, by teaching them German, open their minds to the aims and policies of
the government. The announced purpose of the Bismarck government was to
introduce ethnic minorities to the "language of state" in order to make them
"members of the state," while permitting them to retain their mother
tongues.72 What to Bismarck and to other ministers and officials was a justifiable policy of German self-preservation was to the Poles a drastic threat to
their cultural heritage and ethnic identity.73 In politics the difference between

offense and defense is often unclear. In this case what was defensive for Germans was offensive to Poles.

The Danish Problem
The annexation of Schleswig-Holstein in 1866 produced another problem of
assimilation. Of the 401,925 inhabitants of Schleswig in 1864, 142,940 (36
percent) spoke Danish. Under the treaty of 1864 Danes had the option of
choosing Danish citizenship. Those who exercised the option could emigrate
with their property to Denmark or remain resident with their property in
Schleswig. Not until the wars of 1866 and 1870 did this choice become popular, chiefly among young men subject to military service. Despite their antiGerman sentiments, most Danes elected to remain in the homeland where
their families had lived for generations. For half a century the Danish minority, seconded by the government and newspaper press of Denmark, protested
German rule. The electoral districts were designed to favor German candidates; yet Danish voters managed regularly to elect one protest deputy (two
in 1881) to the German Reichstag. Although two Danes were elected to the
Prussian Landtag in 1866, they refused to swear allegiance to the Prussian
constitution (on the grounds that the oath would recognize the annexation)
and were not seated; in 1882 an elected candidate finally accepted the oath—
out of practicality, not conviction.74
The problem of the Danish minority was exacerbated by the failure of negotiations that might have led to the partition of Schleswig. At the London
conference during the war of 1864 the two sides failed to agree on a line of
partition and, when the war ended, the Danes were compelled to cede the
entire duchy. In article 5 of the Treaty of Prague (1866) Prussia agreed to part
with the northern districts of Schleswig, if the inhabitants "show their desire
to be united with Denmark in a free vote." During 1867-1868 negotiations
between Berlin and Copenhagen foundered on disagreements over the configuration of the frontier and guarantees to be accorded the minorities remaining
in mixed regions. A decade later, in the negotiations that led to the Congress
of Berlin and the Dual Alliance of 1879 Bismarck gained Austria's consent to
void article 5. Since Prussia's commitment had been to Austria, not Denmark, this ended the matter as far as the Wilhelmstrasse was concerned.75

Historians have disagreed on whether Bismarck sincerely desired a better
ethnic frontier in northern Schleswig. Those who grant him sincerity are uncertain when and why he changed his mind.7<s But there seems to be no reason
to doubt that the Danish government, if it had not seriously overestimated its
prospects, could have gained at the London conference the same frontier it
acquired at Versailles in 1919.77 In view of the Polish experience Bismarck
"held that rule over alien nationalities was scarcely desirable."'8 Once the
Danes were defeated, however, he concluded that military considerations
must override the ethnic factor in establishing the line of partition. As later
in the case of Metz, he accepted the contention of Wilhelm and his generals
that Flensburg, Diippel, and Alsen must remain in Prussian hands. But he
also desired to establish the new border so far north that no significant German enclave would be left under Danish rule. Since this meant the inclusion
of Danish districts in Germany, the Prussian commitment at Prague to hold a
plebiscite cannot be taken at full value. Yet the Danes might still have gained
a significant rectification of the frontier in the negotiations of 1867-1868 if
they could have accepted the border offered and minority guarantees demanded by Berlin.
Bismarck often contended that the surrender of northern Schleswig was
made impossible by the resistance of the king, the military, and German public opinion.79 What he meant was that, in the absence of any compelling
reason provided by European politics, there was no need to force a confrontation over the issue with Wilhelm and his generals or to affront German
public opinion by ceding what the Danes demanded. No line of partition

acceptable from the military point of view, furthermore, would have ended
the ethnic problem; many Danes and Germans would have been left on the
wrong side of the frontier. Still, as long as war with France loomed and a
revanchist party lowered in Vienna, Bismarck kept open the question of a
border rectification. The victory over France ended simultaneously the threat
that Napoleon might intervene in behalf of Danish irredentism and that Denmark might ally with a German foe. The prospect of a border rectification no
longer served any purpose in Germany's foreign relations. Article 5 was now
just an embarrassment, a weak point in the armor of German foreign policy,
to be removed at the earliest opportunity. In 1878-1879 Bismarck found his
chance.
In the beginning the provincial government of Schleswig-Holstein under
the governor Baron von Scheel-Plessen followed, on Bismarck's instructions,
a mild policy toward the Danish population. Local administrators who would
have preferred a hard line were frequently overruled. More than a thousand
young men who opted for Denmark in order to avoid military service were
permitted to return under the Convention of Apenrade of January 1872. By
1881, 25,000 Danish citizens were resident in northern Schleswig, in contrast
to 4,575 in 1867.8° Under Prussian regulations of 1864 the affected residents
of each school district could decide by majority vote whether German should
be the language of instruction in the elementary schools. "A predominant
majority bordering on unanimity" could choose three to six hours of instruction weekly in the German language. In early 1870 the Kultusministerium proposed that German be introduced as the sole language of instruction beyond
the second or third year in the elementary schools and that Danish be restricted to instruction in religion—"as in the Polish districts of West Prussia
and Posen." Bismarck doubted "the necessity of going so far so soon." He
advised his colleagues "to be satisfied for now to declare the German language
an obligatory subject of instruction, to which about six hours per week must
be devoted. In this form the measure would appear to be unquestionably the
result of a natural concern for the welfare [of the pupils], distant from the
question of Germanization. Later we can go further."81 The ministers accepted Bismarck's judgment, which was incorporated in an instruction to the
provincial government issued on August 26, 1871.82

Perhaps because war intervened, there was a delay in the execution of the decision of May 30,
1870. On May 16, 1871, Bismarck demanded "that the introduction of the German language in
the schools of North Schleswig be expedited" in accordance with the cabinet's decision of the
previous year. Poschinger, ed., Bismarck-Portefeuille, I, 22.

30, 1870, stand alone in the files of the Prussian cabinet and imperial chan­
cellery as evidence of Bismarck's intentions with regard to the Danish minor­
ity. Silence has even been construed as proof of his detachment. Prussian
officials, not Bismarck, are seen as the authors of the policy of Germanization
that began in northern Schleswig during the late 1870s.83 But Prussian policy
toward the Danish minority cannot be studied apart from Prussian policy to­
ward the Polish and Lithuanian minorities and German imperial policy to­
ward the French minority. Bismarck, the Prussian cabinet, and imperial gov­
ernment had a single policy toward linguistic minorities. That Prussian
ministers (including Bismarck) spoke primarily of Posen, West Prussia, and
Upper Silesia in formulating and executing that policy was because those
regions contained millions who spoke an alien tongue; Schleswig, only
thousands.
The successive steps in the government's attack on the "Danish question"
were either identical with or parallel to those taken on the "Polish question."
The school inspection act of 1872 gave the state the power to end the role of
Danish clergymen in the schools. Although the language of government act
of 1876 made German the only official language for government business,
exceptions were permitted, including several counties inhabited by Danes in
North Schleswig. In 1881 this exception was cancelled, five years ahead of its
cancellation in French-, Polish-, and Lithuanian-speaking regions.84 On the
grounds that the language of government act of 1876 made necessary an in­
creased knowledge of German, the Schleswig district government in March
1878 was authorized by Berlin (against the better judgment of provincial Gov­
ernor Scheel-Plessen and county counselors of the four most affected districts)
to make obligatory the teaching of German on all levels of all elementary
schools in North Schleswig—three hours weekly on the lower level, seven
hours on the upper levels. The use of German as the language of instruction
was required for two hours weekly on the middle and upper levels. German
could be made the sole language of instruction by action of the governor or
by the majority vote of affected parents. 85

Alsace (600,400), and Lorraine (489,400). Of the inhabitants of the two
Alsatian districts about 50,000 spoke French. In Lorraine about 135,000
spoke French. Town dwellers tended to be bilingual; Metz and its environs,
however, were almost solidly French. Whether French- or German-speaking,
the inhabitants of all three districts were opposed to annexation. After two
centuries of French rule, the German-speaking population could no longer
identify with their ethnic brethren across the border. Participation in the
events of the French Revolution and Napoleonic era, particularly in its economic and social reforms, had established new bonds with France that tended
to transcend without erasing ethnic differences. During the industrial revolution of the nineteenth century the economy of the region had become intimately linked with the French economy as a whole. Yet there were lingering
ethnic and political tensions between Alsace-Lorraine and the rest of France
that the German government might have been able to exploit in its effort to
assimilate the population.86
In Germany there were no illusions about the loyalties of the annexed people—only about the speed with which the German-speaking inhabitants
could be assimilated. The Reichstag debate on the annexation bill in MayJune 1871 mirrored the variety of motives and expectations with which Bismarck and members of the Reichstag viewed annexation and the problem of
assimilation. As before, Bismarck based the case for annexation on the requirements of military security. For three hundred years, he contended, almost every generation of Germans had been compelled to "draw the sword
against France." When victorious, the Germans had been prevented by their
allies from gaining a defensible frontier. The lack of it had prevented south
German governments from pursuing their real interests in times of crisis with
France. Without Strassburg, the "sally port" of the French, the south would
never feel secure in a united Germany. Speakers for the liberal parties justified
annexation upon historical and ethnic grounds, as well as on the requirements
of defense. At the extremes were Wilhelm Lowe, who stressed the latter motive to the exclusion of the former, and Franz Wigard, of whom the reverse
was true. Typical of the ethnic arguments were the assertions of Eduard Lasker
and Max tXincker that the inhabitants were "for the most part our nationality," and "flesh of our flesh and blood of our blood." Only among splinter
groups on the extreme left of the chamber (Leopold Sonnemann and August
Bebel) was there any conviction that military security and ethnic character
were inadequate grounds for denying to the annexed people the right of selfdetermination. To reject the existence of a "collective will" and the right of

"collective action by the nation," argued Schulze-Delitzsch, was to attack the
"very heart of nationality."
While rejecting history and ethnicity as grounds for annexation, Bismarck
believed that the "basically German [urdeutsch]" character of the inhabitants
would ease their assimilation. That they had been won by the French was in
itself evidence that they possessed "in high degree" those Germanic qualities
that distinguished Germans from Frenchmen. Their "industry and love of order" had made them a "kind of aristocracy in France." Their "greater ability"
and "greater reliability" had given them a place in French military and public
service far out of proportion to their actual number. That they identified
themselves with France was proof of their "German character," for it was a
peculiarity of the Germans that every Stamm wished to establish its superiority
over its nearest neighbor. Backed by the "glitter" of Paris and the "unified
greatness" of France, the Alsatians and Lorrainers had been able to look down
on their fellow Germans. Whatever the cause, their antipathy for Germany
was a fact, "and it is our duty to overcome it with patience." If sometimes
more clumsy than the French, German statesmen were accustomed "to govern with greater benevolence and humaneness." This superiority of the "German nature" would soon seduce "the German hearts of the Alsatians." "I
believe therefore that we shall succeed through German patience and German benevolence in winning our countrymen there—perhaps in less time
than is now expected."87
The ambivalence on which the German effort to assimilate Alsace-Lorraine ultimately foundered was already evident in this debate. The inhabitants were informed that their incorporation in Germany was an act of Realpoliuk, that they were wanted not for their own sake, but for the terrain on
which they lived; yet they were also assured that the Germans had come as
liberators, that annexation was but the final stage in the liberation of the
German Volksgeist from the bondage of French culture. They were told both
that they were "German" and that they must be "Germanized" (Treitschke:
"The work of Germanization will succeed and must succeed. . . . The voice
of the blood will speak again in Alsace"). They were denied equality of status
within the new empire because they were anti-German; lacking equality, they
were all the more inclined to disloyalty.88
Soon after the German armies had moved into northern France, the region
to be annexed was separated administratively from the rest of France and
placed under a governor-general, Count Bismarck-Bohlen, the chancellor's
cousin. The decree creating this office was signed by Wilhelm as king of Prussia and commander-in-chief of the German forces. Bismarck-Bohlen thought

that "his main task should be to alleviate the misery caused by the war, and
to render the Alsatians well disposed toward the future masters of the coun­
try." But the chancellor disagreed, and, while the war lasted, Alsace-Lorraine
89
received no better treatment than the rest of occupied France. The annex­
ation statute (June 9, 1871) ended military rule, but introduced a "dictator­
ship" lasting until January 1, 1873 (later extended one year). During this
period the Kaiser exercised the executive power, acting through the chancel­
lor and a governor-general in Strassburg (now Eduard von Moller). The only
restriction placed on the Kaiser's power was the provision that legislation re­
quired the agreement of the Bundesrat and that loans and financial guarantees
burdening the Reich had to be approved by the Reichstag.90 Nor did the dic­
tatorship end on January 1, 1874. The executive power remained as before in
the hands of Kaiser, chancellor, and governor-general. The Reichstag, en­
larged by fifteen members elected from the Reichsland, now shared legislative
power with the Bundesrat, which had no representation from the Reichsland.
But the Kaiser retained the power to rule by decree pending approval by the
Reichstag.91 The Reichsland was an anomaly in the government of the
Reich—a unitary province in a federal state. Alsatians called it "Germany's
first colony." Not until 1911 did the Reichsland receive a constitution and a
degree of autonomy nearly equivalent to that of the empire's federal states.
The first target of the protest movement of Alsace-Lorraine was the French
government, not the German. In February 1871 the seventeen delegates from
Alsace and Lorraine to the French National Assembly at Bordeaux protested
the assembly's acceptance of Germany's peace terms. Three years later the
fifteen deputies elected to the Reichstag demanded, on their first appearance
in that body, a plebiscite to ascertain the wishes of the population. Their
spokesman—an Alsatian named Teutsch (!), whose request to speak in
French was denied—was frequently interrupted by hooting and laughter. The
discourtesy, widely reported in the European press, "aroused the impression
that Germany was contemptuous of the feelings of its new subjects and
stamped their representatives as martyrs of their convictions."92 "We shall rely
on God! We shall rely on the decision of Europe" was Teutsch's final cry. But
it was soon evident that the Alsatians could not even rely on each other. The
bishop of Strassburg, Andreas Raess, who had signed the plebiscite demand,
now disavowed it. "Alsatians and Lorrainers of my faith," he declared, "are
not at all inclined to question the validity of a treaty signed by two great
powers."93

The deputies and their constituents divided into three political groups:
"protesters," "autonomists," and Catholic clericals. The protesters were uncompromisingly opposed to German rule under all circumstances; the autonomists, although no less opposed to annexation, hoped through collaboration
to attain for the Reichsland the status of a German federal state. While
protesters and clericals dominated the election of 1874, the autonomists were
victorious in 1877; the clericals strove primarily to protect Catholic interests,
particularly in Lower Alsace.94 On arriving in Berlin the autonomists established contact with Bismarck and the National Liberal party. "We come before you," declared their leader August Schneegans, "as German representatives of a German territory."95
Bismarck was not opposed in the beginning to the idea of federal autonomy
for Alsace-Lorraine. In the annexation debate of 1871 he had contended that
the particularistic attitudes that Alsatians had harbored "in typical German
fashion" during two centuries of French rule were a foundation upon which
the new regime could build. "The more the residents of Alsace feel themselves to be Alsatians, the more they will discard their Frenchness." Once
they had fully identified themselves as Alsatians, they would "logically" conceive of themselves as Germans.96 As a means to that end Bismarck encouraged the Reichsland deputies in 1877 to seek support in the Reichstag for an
autonomous Reichsland. Yet he opposed as too far-reaching the program that
Schneegans presented in 1878, under which the Reichsland would have been
linked to the Reich only by "personal union" under the Kaiser, on the pattern
of Luxemburg and the Netherlands. He was alarmed, furthermore, by
Schneegans's contention that historically Alsace-Lorraine had always mediated between the two great peoples (Kulturvolker) of Europe, transmitting the
best of each culture to the other. Both the proposal and the argument made
in its defense smacked of neutralization, and a neutralized Alsace-Lorraine,
Bismarck believed, would inevitably side with France in any future crisis.97
Out of the collaboration between Bismarck, the autonomists, and national
liberals came a series of statutes culminating in the act of July 4, 1879, which
created a territorial assembly (Landesausschuss) chosen indirectly and invested
with power to initiate bills. The Kaiser's executive authority was delegated to
a governor (Statthcdter) assisted by a "ministry for Alsace-Lorraine"—in reality
a miniature cabinet headed by a legally "responsible" state-secretary and situated in Strassburg. (The imperial office for Alsace-Lorraine at Berlin was
dissolved.) This statute, under which the Reichsland was governed until
1911, stopped short of autonomy. Under it all laws passed in Strassburg had
to be approved by the Bundesrat (in which the Reichsland now had represen94

tation, but no votes) and by the Kaiser, who also appointed the governor and
high officials of the ministry. Bundesrat and Reichstag, furthermore, retained
the power to legislate for the territory. The laws they passed took precedence
over bills passed by the territorial assembly. The Kaiser, furthermore, kept his
power to rule by decree while the Reichstag was not in session.'8
The limited self-government achieved under this statute did not satisfy the
autonomists, not to speak of the protesters. They might have been happier
had Bismarck succeeded with his proposal that Crown Prince Friedrich WiIhelm assume the governorship, establish his residence in Strassburg, and play
an active role in its government. The territory would then have become the
Dauphine or Wales of the Hohenzollern monarchy. But the plan collapsed in
1878 when the crown prince had to substitute for the Kaiser while the latter
recovered from wounds suffered in an attempted assassination." Instead Bismarck chose as governor in succession two prominent figures: Edwin von
Manteuffel (1879-1885) and Prince Chlodwig zu Hohenlohe-Schillingsfurst
(1885-1894). Even if the Reichsland had received a surrogate monarch in the
person of Friedrich Wilhelm, it would have still lacked one of the principal
attributes of a federal state—voting membership in the Bundesrat. This Bismarck opposed in the belief that, since the Reichsland delegates would inevitably vote with Prussia in the chamber, it would be unacceptable to the other
federal states. 1C° The disappointment of the autonomists was keen. They refused to accept posts in the Reichsland administration and, under the influence of Leon-Michel Gambetta, became reconciled to the protesters. Only
Schneegans remained loyal to the program of collaboration. Completely isolated by the apostasy of his followers, he retired from politics, accepting a post
in the Prussian consular service.IDI
Meanwhile, the task of assimilation was pursued in other ways, one of
which was the encouragement of mass emigration in order to rid the territory
of its disaffected population.I01 An "option clause" of the Treaty of Frankfurt
granted inhabitants the right to emigrate to France. By October 1, 1872,
538,568 persons (one-third of the total population) had declared their intent
to do so. Of these 378,777 were already living as emigres in France and chose
to stay there. A disproportionately large number of the 159,791 Optanten
then resident in Alsace-Lorraine lived in regions that were most solidly German-speaking (91,962 in Upper Alsace, 39,190 in Lower Alsace), while the
smallest number (28,639) lived in Lorraine. Yet only 50,148 actually emigrated, of whom 21,739 came from Lorraine. Here the solidly French-speaks8 SBR (1879), pp. 556-671, 1616-1639, 1737-1775; RGB (1879), pp. 165-169; BP, I, i 6 r 172; II, 261-264, 318, 322-323.

ing regions were the greatest losers, especially the city and county of Metz.
The Optanten of 1871-1873 were followed by a steady stream of emigrants in
later years. About 300,000 of the 480,000 emigrants from Alsace-Lorraine
between 1870 and 1014 settled in France, where they kept alive the cause of
recovery and revenge. They were drawn from all classes and occupations. Emigration was difficult for people of property, but relatively easy for artisans,
laborers, and professional people. Many were young men eager to evade conscription into the German army. The emigrants were replaced by migrants
from "old Germany," some of whom were carpetbagger types. Between 1871
and 1910 the number of "old Germans" residing in Alsace-Lorraine rose from
78,687 to 295,436. Often they met hostility from the natives and returned
the same.103
Capital also migrated. For the Alsatian textile industry—the most flourishing industry of the region—annexation was particularly disruptive. Manufacturers were cut off from normal markets, spinners and weavers from dyers and
printers. Their entry into the German Zollverein, on the other hand, spread
panic among German textile manufacturers, whose plants were outmoded in
contrast to the Alsatian. The transition was eased by a German-French tariff
agreement that held the French border open for Alsatian textiles until 1873.
Still, many Alsatian textile manufacturers either abandoned Alsace altogether or at least shifted the center of their operations to branches in France.
Their departure depressed the textile machinery and chemical industries. Lorraine iron manufacturers faced the same problem, and here too there was
some loss of capital as industrialists shifted their operations to ore fields on
the other side of the border. Capital for development of the Lorraine deposits
(after the Gilchrist Thomas process made possible the smelting of phosphorous ores) came from "old German" and foreign sources. Initially Lorraine ore
was shipped to mills in Rhineland-Westphalia for processing, a natural division of labor. Rhenish and Westphalian iron makers agitated for a Moselle
canal for readier and cheaper transport of the ore. But the agitation died in
the 1890s when Lorraine industrialists built their own smelters; the partners
had become competitors.
Another opportunity for closer economic links between the Reichsland and
the rest of Germany came in the 1880s, when Bismarck proposed a state monopoly on the processing and sale of tobacco. The monopoly would have
expanded the state-owned tobacco factory in Strassburg (one of the fiscal
fruits of annexation) and provided a growing market for local tobacco growers. But Bismarck's project was defeated. Throughout its history the Reichsland was never fully integrated into the German economy. Material ties that

would have reinforced Germanization were not as strong as they might have
been. I04
As used by Bismarck, the terms "Germanization" and "re-Germanization"
had a cultural as well as a political import. '° 5 Since its conquest by France
under Louis XIV, the linguistic map of Alsace-Lorraine appears to have
changed little. Attempts by Napoleon III in the 1860s to "Frenchify" the
German-speaking population through the schools made little headway. But
that did not deter Bismarck from instituting the same policy in reverse after
1871. On April 14, 1871, the teaching of French was prohibited irrthe lower
grades of elementary schools. In October 1872 the prohibition was extended
to the upper grades, except where for commercial reasons fluent French was
needed; here up to four hours of instruction weekly were permitted. On January 4, 1874, elementary schools were ordered to use German as the language
of instruction. Again there were exceptions: classes in which all pupils were
French-speaking and mixed classes for which the government made the decision. Schools in French-speaking and mixed districts were required to give
five hours of instruction in German weekly and were permitted three to six
hours of instruction in French. In the secondary schools French was permitted
as the language of instruction wherever all students were French-speaking.
Where this was not the case French was used only in courses on the French
language and literature. Initially French instruction was permitted in the
Gymnasia from four to six hours weekly, German instruction for only three.
New regulations in 1878 cut French instruction to three and in 1883 to two
hours weekly. Until 1888 teachers of science and mathematics were permitted
to instruct in French, as long as they taught the German equivalents of technical terms. Students taking science examinations could respond in either
French or German. Compositions could be composed in either language, stylistic requirements being less stringent for French-speaking students writing
in German. In French-speaking regions normal schools for the education of
teachers continued to instruct in French unless directed otherwise by the government. Teaching examinations were normally in German, but exceptions
were made for French-speaking candidates.Io6
A restored University of Strassburg was intended to be a major instrument
for the cultural penetration of the Reichsland. Founded in 1621, the university had been one of Germany's finest at the end of the eighteenth century.
Here Goethe had studied and first met Herder. But in 1793 the revolutionary
government had reduced the university to a mere academy for the training of
Lutheran pastors. In April 1872 the university was refounded as the Kaiser

language policy in the schools can be seen in the minutes of the cabinet meeting in which the
matter was first discussed (Mar. 25, 1871). DZA Merseburg, Rep. 90a, B, III, 2b, Nr. 6, Vol. 83.

WiUxelm Universitdt. But the faculty was predominantly Protestant; until 1903
no Catholic theological faculty was provided; and the students came largely
from "old Germany." The policy of Germanization was evident in many other
areas of public life. German became the language of all official documents, of
administration within the bureaucracy, of deliberation in the territorial assembly, and of the courts (unless litigants or witnesses knew only French).
The names of streets, highways, and railway stations were Germanized.107
As in Hanover Bismarck applied in the Reichsland the classic technique of
the iron hand in velvet glove. In his instructions to Oberprdsident Moller during the early seventies he directed that collaborators were to be well treated,
antipathy was to be met with patience, active opposition with firmness. The
"ringleaders" of anti-German agitation were to be expelled, conspirators were
to be tried for high treason. Relations between the natives and the French
government and French organizations were to be severed, the Reichsland
sealed off from French influence. Jesuit schools were to be closed; clerical
teachers who were "poisonous in their effect on the German spirit" were to
be dismissed. Yet every effort was to be made to avoid the impression that the
Reichsland was being "Prussianized." Native officials were to be employed
wherever possible. Lesser officials imported from Prussia were to be sternly
chastised for discourtesy and high-handedness in dealing with the public; "the
French endure injustice better than rudeness." Before important decisions
were made by the administration the population was to be consulted through
their elected representatives. Treasury surpluses were to be expended in the
Reichsland, not transferred to Berlin, lest the impression grow that AlsaceLorraine was being exploited like a colonial possession.Io8
Bismarck was "pleasantly surprised" by Moller's success in gaining the confidence of the "pro-German" element, but annoyed by the independence the
official showed in reporting directly to the Kaiser.IOQ As governor, Manteuffel
had constitutionally the independence that Moller had usurped, and Bismarck withdrew for a time from active participation in Reichsland affairs. He
hoped that Manteuffel's prestige as a field marshal, former chief of the Prussian military cabinet, former governor of Schleswig, military governor of occupied France during 1871-1873, and commander of the 15th Army Corps in
Alsace-Lorraine, would impress the natives. Manteuffel governed somewhat
in the manner of a petty potentate. On certain days of the week he opened
his door to the lowliest citizens, listening to their grievances and accepting
their petitions. But his primary effort was devoted to winning the upper class
of wealthy businessmen, big landowners, and high churchmen whom he lavishly entertained. Subordinates, who resented his autocratic ways, claimed

that the ordinary citizen found that the best channel for the solution of his
problems was through these pro-French notables, rather than through government officials. Being Francophile seemed to have its rewards.'IO
Bismarck was critical of Manteuffel's efforts. Germany's future, he believed, lay with the farmers and the inhabitants of the small towns, where
only the German dialect was spoken. Here was to be found the unspoiled
"German kernel" which would sprout, once the superficial "varnish" (for
once his metaphors got out of control) of French culture had been stripped
away, into a flourishing "German oak." This was the social stratum whose
material interests ought to be nurtured by tax and fiscal reforms. "The obstacle to re-Germanization is to be found among the upper classes of the population, those who have connections with Paris and with French officials and
will cling to them as long as they live." This educated upper class of "Parisians" would have to die off before the large towns could be assimilated. "The
next generation will become German; the farmers always have been." Bismarck believed that in time the population would come to appreciate the
virtues of Prussia's system of communal self-administration, which replaced
the unitary and centralized administrative structure of France. But he also
expected good results from the long-term effects of universal military conscription and officer training, the German system of public elementary
schools, and "the greater stability of German in comparison with French conditions."" 1

An Improvised Executive
HE CONSTITUTION of the North German Confederation did not
provide for a central executive body. And yet one quickly developed
after 1867—the Chancellor's Office (Bundes-, then Reichskanzler'
amt)—under Bismarck's direct authority. The functions of that body
made the chancellorship, originally described as a minor post, the most powerful and prestigious political office in Germany. By his control over the chancellor's office and its successor, the Imperial Chancellery (Reichskanzlei), and
over other imperial agencies, Bismarck soon overshadowed his colleagues in
the Prussian cabinet. His personal ascendancy both in the Reich and in the
Prussian governments ultimately led critics to speak of a "Bismarck dictatorship." Whatever its constitutional implications, this development aided the
consolidation of the German Reich. Like the emperorship, the chancellorship became a national office and its incumbent the dominant figure in national politics. The existence of an imperial executive and, in some areas, of
an imperial administration transcending Prussia and the other state governments gave to the empire a sharper profile in the German public mind.
The chancellorship and its subordinate agencies never ceased to bear signs
of the improvisation that marked their origin. Earlier it was shown that the
vagueness of the constitution on the subject of the Reich executive may have
been a political gambit on Bismarck's part, that from the outset he may have
intended ultimately to assume the position of chancellor and convert it into
an important post. Yet he did not have a clear idea in the beginning what the
future contours of the position would be, how large an administrative staff it
would have, how that staff would be organized, what function it would assume, and above all how it would relate to the Bundesrat and the Prussian
cabinet and administration. These uncertainties were by no means liquidated
by the decisions Bismarck and Rudolf Delbriick made during the early months
and years. On the contrary, they persisted until the end of the Reich itself,
for they constituted problems of structure and coordination that were an inevitable outgrowth of the system Bismarck devised and the circumstances of
its creation. The German Reich never developed a rationalized state administration clearly delineating the lines of responsibility and the relationships of
power. Yet the structure, despite its contradictions and lack of verisimilitude
(or was it because of them?) did provide Bismarck with a vehicle for the satisfaction of his power drive. The cost to Germany was considerable, for the
system was so closely tailored to his personality and needs that no one after
* 129 *

130

* A Time for "Liberalism," 1871-1875 *

him was able to make it work with the same degree of effectiveness. Even he,
furthermore, was dissatisfied with his creation and tinkered continually with
it in the hope of rectifying the inadequacies he perceived.
Birth of the Reichskanzleramt
As amended by the constituent Reichstag, article 17 of the north German
constitution made the chancellor "responsible" by virtue of his countersignature for decrees and ordinances issued by the confederate presidency. Bismarck did not reject the so-called "Bennigsen Amendment" that produced
this result, although he resolutely opposed and defeated every other amendment that would have fundamentally altered the power relationships in his
original constitutional draft—giving reason for the surmise that he secretly
approved of it.' Soon after final adoption of the constitution he obtained from
the Prussian cabinet a unanimous declaration that, "as the constitution now
reads, only the Prussian Minister-President can be chancellor of the confederation."2 Armed with this declaration, Bismarck defined the position and its
relationship to the Prussian cabinet in a manner suitable to his own ends. The
chancellor, he told the ministers in a Votum of June 18, 1867, was "the only
responsible minister of the confederation" and was to head "the entire administration of the confederation." The chancellor himself would handle the
most important affairs, the less important being delegated to a deputy (SteRvertreter), who must possess the "complete confidence" of the chancellor. In
addition, the chancellor must have full control over all other confederate
officials. It was "self-understood," he continued, that the chancellor would
not (in fact, could not) undertake anything important without prior agreement by the Prussian cabinet, but this was an "internal matter of the Prussian
cabinet" that could not be established in any formal way. Prussian ministers
were not to be appointed to the Bundesrat; instead Prussia's delegates to that
body would be "high officials" below ministerial rank, who would take their
instructions from Bismarck alone.3
Bismarck had begun to shape the position that would enable him to dominate the Reich and Prussian administrations in the years to come. In July

unter Bismarck, 1867-1890 (Munster, 1957), pp. 25-28. Morsey conceded that Becker's viewpoint had "much probability for it," but he was still inclined to reject it on the grounds that in
later years Bismarck never admitted having had an ulterior purpose but always attributed his
assumption of the chancellorship to the necessity produced by the Bennigsen amendment. A n d
yet the point was a sensitive one, and in many similar instances (for example, his promotion of
the Hohenzollern candidature of 1870) Bismarck never confessed in later years to ulterior purposes whose existence can now be documented.

1867 he explained to Karl von Savigny why the diplomat could not be offered
the chancellorship as originally promised. "Through the responsibility clause
the chancellor has become to a degree—if not legally, yet actually—the superior of the Prussian cabinet. . . . You are too well acquainted with constitutional law not to realize that the chancellor thereby receives the power of
final decision in the affairs of the Prussian ministries of trade, war, and naval
affairs, of the more important parts of the Finance Ministry, and, if the confederate constitution develops correctly, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. . . .
He receives this authority due to the circumstance that he influences the
Reichstag by granting or withholding his countersignature. Because of this
amendment therefore the chancellor must be simultaneously president of the
Prussian cabinet if the new machine is to function at all."4
In later years the significance of the responsibility clause was the subject of
endless debate among constitutional lawyers. Like the similar clause in the
Prussian constitution, the responsibility of the chancellor was never defined;
nor was any judicial procedure ever established by which he could be impeached for acts contrary to the law. At least one writer thought that as a
consequence the clause had no legal standing; others thought only a "moral
responsibility" was involved; still another interpretation held that the provision had a legal character, but, being lex imperfecta, was unenforceable.5 Yet
there was general agreement that the Bennigsen Amendment of itself led to
the creation of a Reich executive. Hermann Oncken came closer to the probable truth when he wrote, "The constitutional doctrine was able to have this
creative importance for the Reich constitution because it coincided with Bismarck's need for power and his political sense. The effect of the doctrine did
not reach any further than both held necessary."6 If indeed it compelled Bismarck to assume the chancellorship, the responsibility clause did not require
that the Imperial Chancellor's Office reach the dimensions of power and function that it ultimately did.
During the summer of 1867, nevertheless, Bismarck still thought of the
confederate administration in rather modest terms. In his Votum of June 18
he proposed that "confederate officialdom" be organized into eight divisions.
Through a "central division" the chancellor would coordinate the activities
of the other seven divisions, which corresponded to the seven committees of
the Bundesrat (military affairs, maritime affairs, customs and taxation, trade
and commerce, railways, post and telegraph, justice, and accountancy). The
central division was to consist of "at least three members" and a number of
assistants; for the other divisions two members and one or more assistants

would suffice. The divisions and committees were to be linked, in that high
Prussian officers and officials appointed to the Bundesrat to chair its committees, as provided in the constitution, would also function as members of the
corresponding divisions.7
In the same document Bismarck also proposed the creation of a "vice-chancellorship" to be offered to Savigny. He anticipated correctly that the proud
Savigny would reject any such inferior status and had, according to Keudell,
already begun to search for another candidate, preferably one of bourgeois
origin versed in matters of trade and tariff policy.8 No one fitted that description better than Rudolf Delbriick, the able Ministerialdirektor in the Prussian
Ministry of Commerce who for many years had been instrumental in the shaping of Prussian policy in the Zollverein. Writing from Varzin on July 19, Bismarck instructed Thile to discuss the post with Delbriick. "I could expect
energetic assistance from him. I am not particular whether he performs his
duties more in the confederation or in the Ministry of Commerce, placing the
accent here or there. It does not matter whether he assumes the formal title
of vice-chancellor or represents me de facto and alternates in this capacity
with someone from [the ministries] of war, finance, foreign affairs, etc., according to the subject matter concerned. I am ready to yield to his wishes in
this regard and would like very much to hear what he thinks about it." Two
days later, he wrote that he preferred that the title "vice-chancellor" not be
used "for the time being."9
These documents show that Bismarck, though firm in the opinion that
there must be a central administrative organ under his personal control as
chancellor, was undecided in July 1867 concerning what form that organ
would take and to what degree its personnel were to be independent of the
Prussian bureaucracy. In his reply on July 24 Delbriick went straight to the
point. There were, he declared, two alternatives: either Prussian ministers
should assume the administrative tasks of the confederation, acting under Bismarck's responsibility, or the entire administration should be placed under
the direct control of the chancellor. To Delbriick the latter choice was the
"only permissible one." In creating a new institution without precedents to
follow, confusion could only be avoided if one person were invested with authority over the bureaucratic machinery. Reviewing the wording of the constitution as "objectively" as possible, Delbriick pointed out that the powers of
the chancellor as "minister of the Presidency" were extensive. First of all, he
was the "actual administrative head" of the postal and telegraph systems, the

conception of the powers that should go with the title of vice-chancellor—particularly, the right

consular service, and confederate financial affairs. Secondly, he was charged
with "continuing, organized control" over the administration of the customs
and other confederate taxes. Finally, the chancellor must "oversee" the execution of confederate laws by state governments, although in this case no
permanent administrative body was required. He was willing, Delbruck declared, to accept the role of chancellor's "deputy" in organizing the confederate executive only if the "horizon" of its affairs was to be as wide as indicated. "An agency without administration is also without power!" The
responsibilities of such an office, moreover, were incompatible with his existing duties in the Prussian Ministry of Commerce. He was not willing to surrender his "at present modest post" for "one perhaps more prominent, but
powerless."10
Evidently Delbriick's memorandum crystallized Bismarck's thought about
the character of the future Reichskanzleramt. While Delbruck had climbed the
bureaucratic ladder step by step during twenty-five years of service, Bismarck
was an outsider who had reached the top through parliament and the foreign
service. As minister-president and foreign minister he had never been
charged with the routine administration of a government ministry dealing
with internal affairs. Hence Delbriick's advice that the administration of the
confederation had to be separate from that of Prussia and the Bundesrat carried considerable weight. Furthermore, it must now have become clear to
Bismarck that the power he wished to wield as chancellor would never be his
unless he constructed the central administration according to Delbriick's design.
On August io, 1867, Bismarck officially proposed the creation of a confederate chancellor's office (Bundeskanzleramt), "an organ in which the different
administrative branches come together and find their focal point." This document, which Delbruck composed, listed again the various administrative
and supervisory functions under the constitution, but added another of which
there was no mention in the basic law. The chancellor's office was "to prepare
with the cooperation of the departments concerned those matters that are to
be brought before the Bundesrat and the Reichstag by Prussia, as leader and
member of the North German Confederation."11 This was the first mention
of those "presidential bills" that in the future were to alter considerably the
relationship between the chancellor's office and the Bundesrat and Prussian
cabinet.
With the official establishment on August 12, 1867, of the Bundeshmzleramt there came into being an organ that was to be of fundamental importance
for the consolidation of the German Reich and for shifting the constitutional
balance away from the federal and decentralistic toward the unitary and cen10

tralistic side. Through it Germany was to acquire a national executive distinct
from the Bundesrat and the Prussian cabinet. The substitution of Delbriick,
the professional administrator and economic expert, for Savigny, the diplomat, was indicative of the coming transition in the character of the chancellorship. What originally had been presented as a diplomatic post reminiscent
of Frankfurt and the German confederation had become an executive position
at the head of an administrative body. Bismarck had acquired a new instrument of power with which to fulfill that burning ambition of earlier years, the
desire to "dispose over the whole."12

Evolution of the Reich Executive
In the beginning Delbriick appeared ideal for the execution of Bismarck's objective.13 Being bourgeois, he lacked the status-consciousness that made it
impossible for Savigny to occupy a subordinate post. An experienced and effective administrator, one of the finest products of the Prussian bureaucracy,
he was without social or political ambition. There was little danger that he
would try to usurp the power of his superior. In 1862 he had refused the opportunity to become minister of commerce, preferring the anonymity and
greater longevity of the privy counselor to the political and often perishable
role of a cabinet minister. From this subordinate position, nevertheless, he
had been the principal architect of the free-trade economic policy and of the
aggressive policy in the Zollverein that finally defeated the Austrian plan for
a central European economic union. In 1865 n e refused ennoblement, accepting it only after his retirement in 1876. His economic liberalism enabled
him to work effectively with the parliamentary majority in the Reichstag after
1867. Yet his tact in handling the federated governments enabled him to be
equally effective within the Bundesrat, over which he presided as Bismarck's
deputy. Where Delbriick was in charge the bureaucratic machine functioned.
Bismarck spoke of him in 1870 as "the only man . . . fully conversant with
all the aspects of his office."14 Yet he was unable to tell even Delbriick to his
face how he felt about this achievement. "You know that my capacity for
recognition is not very great," he wrote to Johanna in November 1870, asking
her to relay to Delbriick his admiration for the energy and success with which
the counselor carried out his duties.I5 This praise was not earned without cost.

RUDOLF DELBRUCK. (B1LDARCHIV PREUSSISCHER KULTURBESITZ.)

Delbriick's effectiveness in interpreting and executing Bismarck's will and in
submerging his own personality caused him to be called "vice-Bismarck," a
sobriquet whose intent was not always kindly.
Because of the vagueness of the constitution and of Bismarck's own views
much depended in the beginning upon Delbriick's conception of the chancellor's office and the steps he took to implement it. The decision to submit
"presidential bills" meant that the office had to be staffed with officials able
to draft laws. Every statute passed by the Reichstag and Bundesrat added to
the supervisory functions of the chancellor's office, since the chancellor was
charged with the duty of overseeing their administration by the states. The
function of direct administration was also destined to grow, for the administrative chores of a modern state could not be performed entirely by state governments. The needs of an industrializing, increasingly complex society
forced a steady expansion in the functions of the central government. Inevitably the growth of the imperial administration produced new problems in
internal organization and constitutional relationships that strained the monocratic system of ministerial responsibility that was the basis for Bismarck's
personal authority. For the time being Delbriick met these problems in ways
that were sympathetic to Bismarck's purposes. As the chancellor's deputy he
strove to retain full control over the growing functions and divisions of the
office he headed. But he also sought to preserve harmony between the central

136

* A Time for "Liberalism," 1 8 7 1 - 1 8 7 5 *

administration and the Prussian cabinet, particularly in the fields of finance
and military affairs.
The growth of the chancellor's office after 1867 can be seen in the proliferation of its subordinate divisions. In December of that year it acquired, as
provided in the constitution, direct administration over the postal and telegraph systems, which became divisions I and II. In 1871 these divisions extended their authority over the southern states (except for certain "reserved
rights" in Bavaria and Wurttemberg) and in 1872 over Alsace-Lorraine. The
purchase of the Thurn and Taxis postal system in 1867 had made the mails a
state monopoly. In Heinrich Stephan division I found an able and energetic
administrator who aimed to make the presence of the Reich felt throughout
Germany through the erection of post offices even in remote villages. In 1871
division III was formed to govern the Reichsland of Alsace-Lorraine. With
the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine and the decision to administer it as an
imperial territory the chancellor's office gained the power of direct administration over 1,550,000 people.'6 Bismarck saw in this task "a most natural
means for creating a closer relationship between north and south."17 By adding a new dimension to the chancellor's office it also contributed to the
growth of centralism. Even after the introduction of the Reich constitution
at the beginning of 1874 the chancellor's office continued to exercise executive authority over the Reichsland, including control over its railways, which
had become imperial property.
In addition to the three numbered divisions the chancellor's office possessed a "central division" that handled such matters as consular affairs, customs, indirect taxes, accountancy, judicial affairs, the drafting of presidential
bills, and the supervisory function over the state governments. The drafting
and passage of imperial law codes and creation of a national judiciary led to
the creation of division IV for judicial affairs in 1875. Economic legislation,
moreover, resulted in the addition to the central division of a number of subagencies; for example, the imperial treasury, war treasury, statistical office,
bureau of standards, and bureaus dealing with emigration and shipping.
By 1871 the functions of the chancellor's office had come to represent, as
Bismarck expressed it, "approximately those of a combined ministry for commerce and finance."18 Throughout this development Delbriick clung steadfastly to his original recipe: that of strict centralization under his own authority as president of the office and deputy to the chancellor, playing the
"Taikun" to Bismarck's "Mikado."19 It was evident, however, that some executive functions had to be conducted in bureaus separate from and parallel

to the chancellor's office. The first of these was that of foreign affairs. Initially
the foreign relations of the North German Confederation were conducted by
the Prussian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whose envoys were accredited to
foreign governments as representatives of the confederation. (Consular and
foreign commercial relations were administered by the central division of the
Chancellor's Office.) That the diplomatic organ of the central government
belonged to a member state was an anomaly, but Bismarck wished to give the
member states, including Prussia, time to readjust to their new situation. In
1868-1869 Prussia's financial crisis and pressure from the Chamber of Deputies expedited a change.20 After January 1, 1870, the Prussian Ministry of
Foreign Affairs was transferred to the confederate budget and renamed the
Confederate Office of Foreign Affairs. Amid the jubilation of victory in 1871
the word "Reich" was substituted for "confederation" in the titles of both the
chancellor's office and the foreign office. Only the Bundesrat retained its old
designation, emphasizing its federal character. After August 1871 all imperial
agencies and officials were henceforth designated as "imperial" (Kaiserlich).
These symbolic changes gave to the unitary tendency of these years yet another forward thrust.21
The foreign office was Bismarck's personal instrument and this fact, plus
the nature and secrecy of its tasks, gave that agency a separate status within
the central administration. One of the changes of 1871 in the constitution
created a Bundesrat "committee on foreign affairs" chaired by the Bavarian
delegate. Although this committee met a few times in 1871, it was, as DeIbruck remarked, a "stillborn child." Its only function was to receive communications from the chancellor on foreign affairs. But even this privilege was
diminished by the fact that there was another, more important channel for
such communications. The Reich Foreign Office also functioned as the Prussian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, controlling Prussia's envoys at the German
capitals who maintained contact with the German federal governments. Although the governments of Bavaria and Wurttemberg continued to maintain
legations in foreign countries under their "reserved rights," their envoys no
longer had political functions. In this way the facade of sovereignty in foreign
relations was maintained for the two southern states, while the building itself
was occupied by Bismarck and the Reich Foreign Office.22
The second bureau established parallel to the chancellor's office was the
Imperial Admiralty (1872). Constitutionally the confederate navy was a national force, in contrast to the army, which was a federal force composed of
state contingents. Yet the navy was commanded by the king of Prussia and
the command and administrative functions were originally performed by the

Prussian naval ministry. Whether naval officials were to be regarded as Prussian or confederate was left undetermined until 1869, when the question of
their tax liability forced the issue. To the great distress of Roon, a majority in
the Prussian cabinet voted to regard them henceforth as confederate officials.
Roon had been unable to follow Bismarck in his migration from Prussian to
German nationalism. Now his "Prussian sense of duty" impelled him to resign
if Bismarck would not help him influence the king to reverse the cabinet
decision. The change in title, he contended, was tantamount to a mediatization of the king of Prussia. Bismarck replied that it was of no consequence
under what form the king ruled in Germany, as long as he did so in fact. The
inhabitants of Oldenburg, Mecklenburg, and the Hanseatic cities who were
liable to naval service would find it easier to serve in a German rather than a
Prussian navy. The former they would serve voluntarily, the latter only under
duress. "If we could have immediately substituted the term 'German' or even
'north German' for 'Prussian' in 1866, we would now be twenty years ahead.
. . . I hope to God that the time will come when our sons will regard it as an
honor to serve the sons of the king in a royal German fleet and in a royal
German army."23 By appealing to Roon's sense of fealty to the king and the
house of Hohenzollern, Bismarck succeeded in overcoming his scruples.
Nevertheless, the position of the navy remained anomalous. While a confederate force, it was commanded by the king of Prussia acting through the
naval high command (Oberkommando der Marine), which was a Prussian
agency. The confederate officials who administered it under the chancellor's
responsibility actually labored in the Prussian naval ministry headed by Roon,
who was not a Reich official. In 1871 the confusion was compounded when
Wilhelm became commander-in-chief of the navy as German Kaiser rather
than Prussian king and Roon recombined the command and administrative
functions by taking charge of the Oberkommando and reintegrating it into the
Prussian naval ministry, from which it had been separated in 1861. An imperial decree of January 1, 1872, cleared away this bureaucratic confusion by
transforming the Prussian naval ministry into the Imperial Admiralty.24 The
first "chief" of that body was General Albrecht von Stosch, who had distinguished himself as an organizer in the war of 1870. There was no longer any
doubt that the navy, its command and its administration, were imperial rather
than Prussian. Yet another ambivalence remained that was to be the source
of difficulty in years ahead. For his command functions the chief of the admiralty was responsible only to the Kaiser, for his administration he acted
under the responsibility of the German chancellor. The two functions were

It was not until 1874, however, that Bismarck succeeded in getting the title "royal navy"
expunged from all documents dealing with naval personnel. See Morsey, Reichsverwakung, pp.

difficult to separate. Furthermore, the chief of the admiralty was also made a
minister without portfolio in the Prussian cabinet, where he was the collegial
equal of the minister-president. In 1871 Bismarck was willing to concede to
Stosch a measure of autonomy in his conduct of the administrative function.
But Stosch was an independent soul, unwilling "to dance to Bismarck's pipe."
In the end this attitude, complicated by the ambiguity in his relationship to
the chancellor, led to his downfall.25
The Reich and Prussia
The origins of the Reidiskanzleramt—its quarters, personnel, and finance—
were almost entirely Prussian. Originally the office was housed at Wilhelmstrasse 74 in rooms made available by the Prussian Staatstnimsterium. As in the
case of Delbriick, its leading officials were transferred from the Prussian to the
confederate service. A credit of twenty thousand thalers from the Prussian
treasury enabled the bureaucratic machine to get started. During Bismarck's
chancellorship only two (Bernhard von Biilow and Karl von Hofrnann) of the
twenty-three officials who occupied the highest rank, that of state secretary,
were non-Prussians. Eighty percent of the officials of secondary status, that of
reporting counselor (Vortragender Rat), stemmed from the Prussian state service. This was true despite the fact that Bismarck made some effort to attract
into the national service able officials from other states. Only among the
higher officials in the diplomatic service (ministers and ambassadors), the
railway office, the Reichsland administration, and the admiralty were nonPrussians present in significant numbers. The Prussian origin of the Reich
bureaucracy was also evident in other respects: for example, the imperial state
service regulations were modeled after those of Prussia; the form of appointment and installation was Prussian; the official dress was patterned after an
old Brandenburg Waffenrock and its colors were those of the Prussian military
uniform. Like Delbriick, the Reich officials found it difficult to forget their
Prussian origins. Most persisted in looking upon Wilhelm as king of Prussia
and only secondarily as German Kaiser.26
It was not Bismarck's intention that the central government should appear
to be but an extension of the Prussian. On the contrary, he strove from 1867
onward to give the government of the confederation and the Reich a distinct
profile that would allay the suspicions of the other state dynasties and governments that they were being Prussianized. In late August 1867 the Saxon envoy in Berlin, Baron von Koenneritz, reported to his government, "Count

the confederation a primary importance in every direction; he appears to desire that these affairs be given the greatest possible independence from those
of the Prussian ministries." The appointment of high-ranking officials, rather
than cabinet ministers, to the Bundesrat and Bismarck's retention of complete control over them "creates a large, unmistakable breach in the higher
Prussian administration. The Prussian ministers are deprived of a good many
attributes, which they must surrender to the confederate chancellor, meaning
to the office of the confederate chancellor." It appeared, Koenneritz wrote in
September, that "Prussia will eventually merge into Germany and not the
reverse." An important Prussian official repined, "Bismarck is ruining the entire Prussian state!"27 In the summer of 1868 the Hessian minister-president,
Baron von Dalwigk, recorded in his diary that the Prussian ministries were
seething with envy and dissatisfaction. Their influence was being "completely
paralyzed by the chancellor's office. The burden of business placed on the
chancellor's office is enormous, moreover, and without Delbruck and his capacity for work the entire complicated machinery would eventually go to
pieces."28
These fears, and perhaps the reports of them as well, were certainly exaggerated. While desiring an independent confederate executive, Delbruck was
eager to avoid any development that would cripple the Prussian bureaucracy
or antagonize former colleagues in the Prussian service. For a time, moreover,
some of the most vital functions of the confederate-Reich government were
in fact performed by Prussian ministries. We have seen that the conduct of
foreign affairs remained within the Prussian cabinet until 1869. The Prussian
war ministry handled confederate military affairs, and the Prussian finance
ministry and superior accounting office had significant roles in the management of confederate finances. These latter areas are most critical for an understanding of the developing relationship between the central government
and Prussia.
Under the constitution the confederation had a very limited tax power. Its
independent sources of income were the customs, surpluses from the post and
telegraph, and certain indirect taxes. What these sources did not provide was
to be supplied by assessments paid by the states according to population. This
meant that the confederate-Reich government was largely dependent upon
the Prussian assessment, which soon became the greatest single burden in the
Prussian budget. For this reason the financial affairs and problems of the central and Prussian governments were interlocked. The national budget had to
be drafted in close collaboration with the Prussian Ministry of Finance, and
without the latter's approval no financial measure could be introduced into
the confederation. The dependence of the confederate government upon

Prussia in financial matters was a subject of frequent criticism in the German
Reichstag, usually coupled with demands for the creation of a national cabinet, including a ministry of finance.
The issue was sharpened by the fact that in the beginning the Prussian
minister of finance did not sit in the Bundesrat. Earlier we have seen that only
high-ranking officials below ministerial rank were made Prussian delegates to
that body. Lacking a seat in the Bundesrat, the minister could not appear in
the Reichstag to defend the budget unless he happened, as did August von
der Heydt, to be an elected member. Naturally this circumstance was regarded
as unsatisfactory by Reichstag liberals, whose debates on this subject will be
discussed later. But it also created problems for the relationship between Bismarck and his Prussian colleagues and between the chancellor's office and the
Prussian Ministry of Finance that required clarification and adjustment during
the early years of the German union. A one-sided consideration of the financial needs of the confederation could endanger the financial stability of the
Prussian state, and, in reverse, the pursuit of strictly Prussian interests by its
Ministry of Finance could harm those of the confederation. How closely the
financial affairs of the central government were meshed with those of Prussia
was clearly evident in the financial crisis of 1868-1869 recounted earlier.29
During 1867-1869 Bismarck's relationship to his colleagues in the Prussian
cabinet steadily deteriorated. Bad health and long absences from Berlin (more
than five months in both 1868 and 1869) made it difficult for him to isolate
the king and prevail over the ministers. His long struggle (recorded earlier)30
with the ministers over the policy to be followed in the annexed regions and,
with the cabinet and conservatives over the Hanoverian provincial fund, the
failure of his attempt to liquidate the state assessments, the general retreat of
the unity movement in southern Germany, and the collapse of his hopes for
evolutionary unification—all combined to increase his general irritability and
heighten the scorn he felt for those seven men whose permission he had to
seek "whenever I want to take a pinch of snuff."31 In May 1869 he vented his
anger openly to the Reichstag in opposing a national liberal-free conservative
bill calling for creation of a Reich cabinet of collegial character. "Whoever
has once been a minister and headed a cabinet and been compelled to make
decisions on his own responsibility no longer shrinks from that responsibility.
What he does shrink from is the necessity of convincing seven people that
what he wants is really the right thing to do. That is different kind of work
than governing a state! All cabinet members have their own firm and honest
convictions. The more honest and industrious they are, the more difficult it
is for them to conform. Each is surrounded by a group of argumentative coun29

selors, who also have their convictions. . . . I consider the collegial cabinet
structure to be a constitutional failure and a mistake. . . . Prussia would make
immense progress, if it would accept the principle of the North German Confederation and have just one responsible minister!"32 Lacking the power to
effect such a change, Bismarck's only course was to build up still further the
chancellor's office at the cost of the cabinet.
When Heydt resigned under fire as Prussian finance minister in October
1869, a possible replacement was Delbruck, who would have assumed that
ministry in addition to the presidency of the chancellor's office. But Delbruck
had no ambition to hold a political office, and, furthermore, such an "accumulation" of offices contradicted his conception of confederate-Prussian relationships. In accepting this decision, Bismarck stressed, nevertheless, that
the new minister of finance, whoever he might be ("a more or less arbitrary,
lottery-like choice"), would have to subordinate himself to the chancellor's
office. "If we succeed in building up your position as a kind of 'confederate
minister of finance' to the point where you gain the necessary influence over
the Prussian financial administration, there will be less danger of failure; the
control would be in your hands."33 Winner of the lottery was Otto Camphausen, president of the Prussian maritime bank (Seehandlung). Bismarck was
pleased with the choice ("finance ministers do not grow wild here"), for
Camphausen was experienced in public finance and his liberal reputation
made him persona grata to the parliamentary majority. Yet he was determined
to make Camphausen's position less powerful than Heydt's had been.
To this end he proposed that Delbruck in addition to his position as president of the chancellor's office, be appointed Prussian minister without portfolio, with the right to participate in all cabinet sessions dealing with confederate affairs, and the right of cosignature with the chancellor on all
confederate documents dealing with confederate finances. The immediate
aim, he informed Delbruck, was to enhance the "moral authority" of the president's position by giving it a more "ministerial character." The ultimate aim
was gradually to rebuild the central executive into a cabinet structure on the
English model, beginning with ministries of war and finance followed by a
ministry of commerce. Naturally such a development would not remain a secret from the allied governments. "But the douce violence, which would gradually be done to them by this route, seems to me much more acceptable than
a constitutional amendment aiming at the same result. Nevertheless, a constitutional amendment will have to be forced through sooner or later if the
waters aren't diverted quietly into the channels I have sketched out."34

glish rather than the Pruss'an pattern ran counter to Delbriick's own concep­
tion of his office. While accepting appointment to the Prussian cabinet, DeIbriick rejected the right of cosignature. Instead he proposed that Camphausen
be appointed to the Bundesrat, where he would be given the power, as chair­
man of the finance committee, to cosign documents dealing with confederate
finances. Bismarck acquiesced, although with obvious reluctance, trusting
that Camphausen would not be influenced by the Prussian collegial principle
in his handling of confederate finances.35 Yet the primary effect of these re­
forms proved to be the opposite of what Bismarck intended. Camphausen
gave more weight to his role in the Prussian cabinet than to his duties in the
Bundesrat. Although his skill in juggling Prussia's finances solved the imme­
diate financial crisis, the greater problem of the relationship between the cen­
tral and Prussian governments remained unsolved.36
Later we shall see that during 1872-1873 a crisis like that of 1868-1869
disturbed Bismarck's relationship to the Prussian cabinet and the Conserva­
tive party. His conflicts with ultraconservatives over clerical influence in the
schools, reform of county government, and reconstruction of the House of
Lords also involved him in sharp differences with the ministers.37 He forced
the resignation of Heinrich von Miihler as Kultusminister (minister of educa­
tion and religious affairs) but failed to unseat Minister of the Interior Friedrich
zu Eulenburg, who evaded Bismarck's attempt to transform the House of
Lords. These frictions and frustrations coincided with another severe illness
that kept Bismarck away from Berlin during most of the year. In December
1872 the climactic point was reached when Roon decided to resign as minister
of war. His health, Roon declared, had suffered from frustrations arising from
the collegial necessity of having to accept actions of the cabinet majority of
which he disapproved, the "rhapsodic and eccentric pressure for legislation in
the present governmental program," and lack of leadership in the cabinet
owing to Bismarck's extended absences. To general astonishment Bismarck's
response was to resign as minister-president and persuade Roon to assume that
post as of January 1, 18 73. 3 8
On January 25 he explained this decision to the Prussian Chamber of Dep­
uties. In contrast to the chancellorship, the minister-presidency was a post
with great responsibility and little power. This "honorific post" lacked the
means with which to make any impression on the other ministers. Supported
by their subordinate officials, they put up a passive resistance that had com35 GW, XIV, 765-766.

pelled him to admit his own powerlessness. Like a walker in loose sand, he
felt exhausted from the effort. To Roon he also complained about the "treasonable desertion of the conservatives in the Catholic question," the loss of
old friends, the impositions and declining favor of the king, and expressed the
conviction that he had not much longer to live.39 By resigning as ministerpresident he hoped to rid himself of the frictions without diminution of his
real power.
If the monarch, as Kaiser, had confidence in the chancellor, Bismarck told
the Chamber of Deputies, it was inconceivable that, as king of Prussia, he
would allow the cabinet to launch a policy to which the chancellor was opposed. "For the king of Prussia and his cabinet to oppose the policy of the
Reich chancellor is an utter impossibility; instead it is a necessity that his
policy be supported." By remaining in the cabinet as minister of foreign affairs
with the power to instruct Prussia's delegates to the Bundesrat, furthermore,
he would be in a position to preserve the connection between Prussia and the
Reich. The separation of the chancellorship and minister-presidency, he continued, would accentuate the German character of the former and thereby
contribute to the growth of a "true German unity."40 To Hohenlohe he remarked, "The Kaiser must above all become accustomed to seeing that he is
more important as Kaiser than as king of Prussia."41 The discarded Miihler
saw the matter in a different light, complaining to Wilhelm, "What Prince
Bismarck was not able to achieve as minister-president he now seeks with
redoubled force and hate to accomplish through the importance of his position as Reich chancellor. As far as he is concerned, the Prussian cabinet is to
sink steadily into nullity."42
The actual course of events corresponded, however, neither to Bismarck's
hopes nor Muhler's fears. During Bismarck's absence from the minister-presidency the internal problems of Prussia and the Reich increased. In 1873 the
Kulturkampf reached a new peak, the breach with the ultraconservatives grew
worse, a financial scandal involved keyfiguresin government and society, and
the crash of the bourse introduced a business depression. Roon, asthmatic and
seventy years old, was even more ill than Bismarck and spent much of the
year on leave. When he did preside over the cabinet, his military manner
grated upon the other ministers. Bismarck, on the other hand, found his burdens unreduced. Because he remained in the cabinet as Prussian foreign minister he continued to share collegial responsibility. He still had to familiarize
himself with the issues and documents but without help from the counselors
attached to the minister-president. That Delbriick voiced Bismarck's views
and cast his proxy in cabinet meetings gave little relief. In May-June 1873

Bismarck wanted to withdraw completely from the Prussian cabinet. But the
ministers objected in view of the upcoming Landtag elections. According to
Lucius, no one could see how the system would operate without his presence.44
Within a few months Bismarck himself was compelled to recognize that the
experiment had failed. When bad health compelled Roon to resign on November 9, 1873, as both minister-president and minister of war, Bismarck
returned to the former office, explaining to Wilhelm that his absence had
diminished neither his burdens nor his responsibility; it had only "increased
the difficulty of making my opinion felt in cabinet meetings." (In the hope of
reducing the burdens of the office he secured Wilhelm's consent to the creation of a "vice-presidency," to which Camphausen was appointed. )45 He had
completely erred, he told the Reichstag later, in believing that the chancellor
alone was "strong enough" to govern successfully. Without the "Prussian
root" he had "no greater influence than any other person."46
After six years of experimentation it was already evident that the political
machinery Bismarck had devised was not adequate for governing a large country. The improvisations of its origin prejudiced its later development. In the
debate on January 25, 1873, the progressive deputy Rudolf Virchow teased
Bismarck with the suggestion that in view of the "dissonances" within the
government perhaps the time had come to convert to a parliamentary system.
In reply the chancellor lamely denied the existence of frictions, of which he
had himself publicly complained, and charged that the multiplicity of parties,
the sharp conflicts between them, and the lack of "feeling for the state" made
it impossible for Prussia to copy the English system of parliamentary responsibility.47 In future years Bismarck never ceased to lecture his colleagues and
parliamentary deputies on the nature and functioning of the Prussian-German
governmental system. It will be shown, however, that his explanations shifted
constantly. Year after year he wrestled continually with a problem that he
never solved. Neither, for that matter, did his successors.

army" was to be composed of state contingents. There was no German general
staff or command structure and no Reich military administration, although
military expenditures were borne by the national budget. These concessions,
however, were illusory. Nowhere in the entire structure was Prussian hegemony so evident as in the provisions concerning the military. The king of
Prussia (after 1871 the German Kaiser) was commander-in-chief, to whom
officers and men swore obedience. Uniforms, insignia, organization, administration, weapons, and training were to follow the Prussian model. Prussian
laws and ordinances governing the military were to be adopted by state governments when the constitution went into effect, including those on military
justice, length of service, quartering, mobilization, and the like.
Prussia's hegemonic position in military affairs soon grew in ways not provided by the federal constitutions of 1867 and 1871. Beginning in 1867 during
the Luxemburg crisis, Prussia negotiated military conventions with other German states that resulted in a largely unitary army. Ultimately they resulted in
Prussia's incorporation (in varying ways and degrees) of twenty-two out of
twenty-five contingents of the imperial army.48 Only Saxony, Wurttemberg,
and Bavaria maintained separate contingents. Even without these acquisitions the Prussian contingent would have been by far the largest in the German army; with them Prussia possessed by 1875 thirteen out of eighteen German army corps. Saxony, Baden, and Wurttemberg each had one and Bavaria
two. Of the 418,872 men in Germany's standing army in 1881, the Prussian
contingent alone supplied 324,766 men. Seven small contingents (Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, Waldeck, the two Lippes, and the three Hanseatic cities) were completely absorbed into the Prussian contingent; ten others (Oldenburg, Brunswick, Anhalt, and seven Thuringian states) formed separate
regiments within the Prussian contingent; four (Baden, Hesse-Darmstadt,
and the two Mecklenburgs) were separate contingents only in outward form,
the latter three retaining their distinguishing insignia. After conscription was
introduced into the Reichsland, the troops of Alsace-Lorraine were also integrated into the Prussian contingent.49
The military conventions circumvented the imperial constitution and were
negotiated and signed without the participation of either the Bundesrat or
Reichstag. Even so, the unitary principle was firmly grounded in the constitutional powers of the Kaiser (until 1871 the king of Prussia) as commanderin-chief. In this capacity he had the "duty and right" to establish and oversee
48

Most of the conventions between Prussia and the north German states were signed in 18671868, but were renegotiated in 1872-1875. That with Baden was signed in 1870 and the last
with Braunschweig in 1886. Georg Meyer and Gerhard Anschutz, Lehrbuch des deutschen Staatsrechts (7th ed., Munich, 1919), pp. 851-852 (fn.); Ernst Rudolf Huber, Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte seit 1789 (4 vols., Stuttgart, 1957-1963), III, 992-1000.

the unity and conformity of the entire army, to determine the internal orga­
nization of all contingents, and to locate all garrisons; in wartime he assumed
direct command of all contingents.50 The staff work necessary to carry out
these and other command functions was performed by the organs of the Prus­
sian contingent. The Prussian military cabinet continued to advise the com­
mander-in-chief on personnel matters relating to the officer corps. The Prus­
sian general staff assumed the function of strategic planning. The Prussian
minister of war communicated directly with his counterparts in those states
that retained separate contingents and tended to wield a superior influence
over them. 51 He also acted as a Reich minister of war.
Nowhere was the problem of coordination between the Reich and Prussia
more difficult than with regard to military affairs. Here reappeared, moreover,
the problem of the relationship between civil and military leadership that had
plagued the wars of 1864, 1866, and 1870-1871. In effect there were two
Reich ministers of war: the Reich chancellor and the Prussian minister of war.
Bismarck maintained that the chancellor was responsible for all military af­
fairs pertaining to the Reich. Yet neither he nor his office was equipped to
perform the administrative functions that followed from that responsibility.
They were actually performed by the Prussian minister of war supported by his
ministry. De jure the ministerial activity of the Reich was carried out by the
Bundesrat committee for military affairs, headed in the beginning by a high
official of the Prussian war ministry and after 1869 by the minister himself.
Roon was de facto an imperial as well as Prussian minister of war.52
The general was, however, dissatisfied with this state of affairs. As Prussian
minister of war he had a special status in the Prussian cabinet, which he
lacked in the Reich. In the former capacity he was the only official, except
the minister-president, who had the right of direct access to the king. Under
the cabinet rule of 1852 all other ministers could only approach the king
through the minister-president. Where military affairs of the Reich were con­
cerned Roon did not have an equivalent right. He found it galling that Bis­
marck, a civilian, was as chancellor the Reich's only minister and hence
countersigned all administrative documents emanating from the Kaiser as
commander-in-chief of the German army. From 1867 onward Roon strove for
the creation of a Reich minister of war who would have the right of counter­
signature. Naturally Bismarck steadfastly resisted this demand, which would

collaborator of the "conflict era." While retaining the right of countersignature for all national laws dealing with military affairs, he yielded to Roon the
right to cosign all reports (lmmediatberichte) dealing with confederate-Reich
military affairs that were destined for the ruler. In this way Wilhelm was assured, without the necessity of inquiry, that the contents had the approval of
the Prussian minister of war. In August 1868, furthermore, the latter was
made the chancellor's deputy {Stellvertreter) in all military and naval affairs.53
There were still other thorns for Roon in the thicket. The duty of the chancellor's office to supervise state governments in their execution of national
laws related to military as well as civilian affairs. As such the office was superior to the Ministry of War and had legally the right to oversee its activities.
Through the power that it assumed over the national budget, furthermore,
the chancellor's office controlled the army's source of financial support. As a
military man, Roon was doubly sensitive about his prerogatives and in the
Prussian tradition disinclined to bow to civilian leadership or control. During
Delbriick's period, however, the problem did not arise, for the president of
the chancellor's office routinely deferred to the Prussian war minister in all
matters touching military affairs. As a result the relationship was "astonishingly" ffictionless.54
Nevertheless, the effort to create a Reich war minister, parallel to the chancellor, did not cease. In 1871 (in connection with the amendment of the
constitution) and in 1873 (in connection with a new military bill) Roon
raised the issue in the Prussian cabinet. Bismarck replied that the Prussian
Ministry of War was already in fact a Reich ministry of war and that this was
enough. To attempt to give it the formal status of a Reich ministry would
unnecessarily antagonize other German governments, which were sensitive
to the "Prussianization" of the Reich. What Roon, Bismarck's long-time
friend and colleague, failed to accomplish was clearly impossible for Georg
von Kameke, his successor as war minister after 1873. On Delbriick's suggestion, Kameke proposed in August 1873 that he be given the right of direct
access to the Kaiser and of countersignature on all imperial orders dealing
with military matters. This earned him a sharp rebuke from the chancellor,
and a year later he received yet another when Bismarck learned that the general had discussed the Reich military budget bill first with the Kaiser rather
than with the chancellor. It was impermissible, he wrote from Varzin, for
Kameke, as the "actual possessor of the Reich military administration," to
ascertain the views of the emperor before coming to terms with the chancellor
as the sole responsible official for the Reich's executive affairs.55
Undoubtedly the principal aim of both Roon and Kameke was to enlarge

their prerogatives and establish that direct relationship with the ruler to
which the Prussian military had always aspired and which in Prussia they had
largely attained. Their effort was the bureaucratic counterpart of the attempt
of Moltke and the military "demi-gods" during the wars of 1864, 1866, and
1870-1871 to assert their freedom to direct military strategy without regard
to those political considerations that were Bismarck's primary concern. Still,
the position of Roon and Kameke under the constitutional order Bismarck
had devised was by no means easy. It lacked the kind of clarity that military
minds tend to prize. In his relationship to the monarch the war minister had
to distinguish between purely Prussian administrative matters, which he could
take directly to Wihelm as king, and imperial administrative matters, which
he could not take directly to Wilhelm as Kaiser. But this was not all. Where
the Kaiser was concerned, the minister had to distinguish between administrative matters, which had to go through the chancellor, and command matters, which did not.
His relationship to the Reichstag was likewise ambiguous. Officially he appeared in that body as a Prussian delegate to the Bundesrat and as chairman
of the Bundesrat committee on military affairs. In this capacity he was compelled to reply to questions concerning bills and policies for which he was
actually, though not formally, responsible. "In a strictly legal sense he was
not bound to answer such questions; in practice it was always difficult, and
sometimes inexpedient, to refuse. Even a man of such determination as Roon
had not always succeeded in distinguishing between questions bearing upon
the forces of the empire (which he could answer) and questions dealing with
the Prussian army (which he could not) or between administrative matters
(which he could discuss) and command questions (which the emperor considered none of the Reichstag's business). Kameke affected liberal political
views, and in parliamentary halls he was inclined to be more compliant than
Roon."' 6

The Decline of Federalism
The imperial constitution granted to the Reich an extensive legislative competence—chiefly in economic, legal, and judicial affairs. The Reich, moreover, steadily increased the range of its own competence at the cost of the
state legislatures. The only distinction made in the constitution between ordinary legislation and constitutional amendments was the provision that fourteen negative votes in the Bundesrat could defeat the latter. Since all Bundesrat decisions were announced as "unanimous," no statute passed by both
Bundesrat and Reichstag could later be called "unconstitutional." Whether a
bill conformed to or amended the constitution was threshed out on the floors

of the Reichstag and Bundesrat in the course of debates on the bill in ques­
tion. 5 7 The meaning of the power known as Kompetenz-Kompetenz (that is,
the power of the Reich to extend its own competence) was the subject of
endless controversy among German authorities on constitutional law. Ac­
cording to one view, it was so elastic that the national parliament could have
amended the constitution to the point of wiping out the legislative compe­
tence of the states.58 Yet the possibility was purely theoretical, for the Bun­
desrat would have rejected any such drastic amendments. Nevertheless, the
power of Kompetenz-Kompetenz did result in significant changes in the consti­
tution. Some of these amendments were formally written into the constitu­
tion, but most were not. As a consequence, the actual scope of the German
constitution was soon larger than the wording of the document indicated.59
As already noted, the decade 1867-Γ878 was most fruitful in the number
of statutes passed that dealt with fundamental economic and legal affairs.
Many of these laws directly affected the population at large and brought it
increasingly into direct relationship to the central government. Those dealing
with justice were the most important in this regard. The constitution of 1867
did not provide for a national judiciary. No use, furthermore, was made of the
jurisdiction that it did grant to the Superior Court of Appeals in the Hanseatic cities, in cases of high treason, and to the Bundesrat, in cases alleging
denial of justice in state courts. (To become effective the latter provision
would have required a law of implementation, which was never passed.)60
Nevertheless, the constitution did grant to the Reich the power to legislate
codes of commercial law, criminal law, and judicial procedure. In 1868 the
Reichstag requested bills for all three codes and, in addition, a bill establish­
ing a common judiciary for their enforcement. The commercial code became
law in 1869 and in the same year an appellate court, the Superior Court of
Commerce (Reichsoberhandehgencht), was established to enforce the code.
The latter act was a constitutional amendment, by far the most important
during the period of the North German Confederation and a significant ex­
tension of the authority of the central government.6' The haste to establish a
central court, even before there was a procedural code, was owing to Bis­
marck's eagerness to seize "every vinculum, even the smallest, as a cement for

German unity."62 In 1871 its jurisdiction was extended to the entire Reich.
It became, furthermore, the supreme court for Alsace-Lorraine and for cases
arising from extraterritorial consular courts.63
The statute of June 21, 1869, establishing the universal validity of judicial
decisions was another instance in which the constitution was extended.
While the constitution had only granted authority for legislation on "the reciprocal execution of judicial sentences in civil matters," this statute was
drafted to cover, with certain limitations, criminal cases as well. Under its
provisions no court could disregard decisions of courts situated in other states.
Requests for judicial aid (Rechtshilfe) went directly between the courts concerned; no court could refuse to comply. No state could give refuge to a criminal convicted by the courts of another state. Bankruptcy proceedings begun
in one state were effective in every other. By this means the state courts became in effect national courts.64 The foundations had been laid for a single,
integrated judiciary acting on the basis of common law codes, following common procedures, and crowned by a common court of appeals.
One of the last deeds of the North German Confederation was enactment
in May 1870 of a code of criminal law, laying down the principles to be followed by state courts in the definition and punishment of criminal offenses.65
Bismarck, who followed the deliberations on this statute with considerable
impatience, regarded it as very important for the "organic growth" of the
confederation and its institutions.66 In 1877 no less than four statutes were
enacted that were of great significance for the integration of the German legal
system: the judiciary code (Genchtsverfassungsgesetz), bankruptcy code, and
codes of civil and criminal procedure.67 The first of these statutes established
the imperial court (Reichsgericht) at Leipzig, which assumed jurisdiction over
both criminal and civil law (except for commercial law). Its judges were nominated by the Bundesrat and appointed by the Kaiser. Through the power of
judicial review the imperial court dominated the German judiciary, a vital
contribution to the uniform interpretation of law. In a few types of litigation,
such as high treason, the imperial court became the tribunal of first instance.
Although the lower courts in the judicial hierarchy were state institutions,
the statutes of 1877 imposed upon them common patterns of organization and
procedure and in criminal law a common imperial code. After 1877 civil law
was the one remaining gap in the development of an integrated German legal
system. Civil law had not been included in the legislative competence of the

central government under the constitution. After 1869 Reichstag liberals ag­
itated for a constitutional amendment to remedy this lack,68 and in 1873 the
amendment was finally approved by the Bundesrat.69 Codification was not
complete until 1896.
Undoubtedly the establishment of common law codes and a unified judici­
ary had a strong impact upon the development of a German national con­
sciousness. Henceforth all Germans regardless of their states of origin were
subject to the same law enforced by courts whose decisions were universally
enforceable and subject to review by national courts. The consolidation of
the German judicial and legal systems affected the daily lives of nearly every
citizen, but it also had a deteriorating effect upon the federal structure of the
Reich. "The permanent unification of law and justice and the retreat of state
citizenship behind Reich citizenship," wrote the historian Heinrich Triepel,
"had the further result that from decade to decade the special territorial rights
of the states lost their actual importance and that, apart from the customs and
commercial affairs, the borders of the states ceased more and more to play any
part within the Reich."7° "The direction of this development," wrote the po­
litical scientist Paul Laband, "must be characterized as decidedly unitary. The
borders of the states have lost their importance for domicile and settlement,
financial relief (except for Bavaria and until now Alsace-Lorraine), business
occupations, and the administration of justice." Through laws of the Reich
the autonomy of the states was in his opinion being steadily absorbed.71 In
1871 a uniform coinage was established based on the gold standard. An "im­
perial gold coin" (Reichsgoldmunze) worth ten marks replaced the Prussian
thaler and all other coins; on one side it bore the imperial eagle and on the
other the likeness of the monarch of the state that minted it—the only con­
cession to particularism.72 In 1870 limitations were placed on issuance of new
banknotes in preparation for the introduction in 1874 of a new currency by
the imperial treasury.73
The bank statute of March 1875, which completed the creation of a single
monetary system, was one of the most important fruits of Bismarck's collabo­
ration with the national liberals. On the Reichstag's insistence the bill pre­
pared by the Prussian Ministry of Finance was rewritten to transform the Bank
of Prussia into an imperial bank (Reichsbank), the principal repository for pub­
lic funds. It provided banking facilities for the entire country, opening
branches and subbranches in every community of importance. As the favored
bank of issue, the Reichsbank controlled the quantity of currency in circulation

and regulated discount and interest rates. Such strict limitations were placed
upon the issue of private banknotes that nearly half of the thirty-three banks
possessing that authority quickly renounced it. The Reichsbank was the crowning institution of the integrated banking system that developed in the 1870s.
It was a semigovernmental body possessing a standing in both public and private law. Control was in the hands of the chancellor who presided over a
supervisory Bankkuratorium and "directed" the Barikdirektorium, which administered the institution. Located in Berlin, the imperial bank was a centralistic institution not provided by the constitution; its creation signified an
important extension of the authority and functions of the central government
and an equivalent sacrifice on the part of the states.74
In 1868 Bismarck told Eulenburg that the Reichstag was the parliamentary
body "whose reinforcement is at present the most important task of Prussian
policy."75 Toward this end he permitted and even encouraged the expansion
of its legislative competence and the exploitation of that competence in the
first decade of its existence. The consequence of the strengthening of the
Reichstag was a corresponding decline in the importance of other legislative
organs. Earlier it has been shown that the system of government created under
the constitution was one of checks and balances, modelled on the balance of
power principle in foreign affairs.76 Reichstag and Bundesrat, Zollverein parliament, Prussian Chamber of Deputies and House of Lords—these three legislatures represented alternative paths for the passage of legislation desired by
the government. The strengthening of any one of these channels weakened
the others. Yet the attempt to enlarge the competence of the Zollverein parliament was unsuccessful before its liquidation in 1871; the Reich inherited
its legislative powers over tariffs, sugar, and tobacco. During the Kulturkampf
of the 1870s the Prussian Landtag remained an important legislative channel,
but thereafter its importance declined. Since imperial statutes took precedence over state laws, the importance of the Reich grew and that of Prussia
and the other states shrank with the passage of every major bill through the
Reichstag and Bundesrat.

Bismarck and Parliament
What Bismarck Expected of Parliament
OR ME there exists but a single compass, a single polar star toward
which I steer: Salus publico.! . . . I have never been doctrinaire in my
life. AU of the systems through which the parties feel themselves
divided and bound are for me of secondary rank. In the first rank
comes the nation—its position toward the outside, its independence, our organization in the sense that we can breathe freely as a great nation in the
world. Everything that may follow after that—whether the constitution is
liberal, reactionary, or conservative—is of secondary importance. This I confess to you, gentlemen, very candidly. Furnishing the house is a luxus, which
has its place once the house itself has been solidly built."1 In this, one of the
most famous of all quotations from his collected works, Bismarck sketched his
favorite self-image: that of "the man of the state and the king" standing above
the chaos of social and political life, seeking without fear or favor, prejudice
or partisanship, the ideal line of policy dictated by the reasoned interest of
state.2
While believing Germany's exposed position in the middle of Europe necessitated authoritarian control over foreign policy and military affairs, he
regarded absolutism as "the most unfortunate of all forms of government."
Where the king possessed full power, ministers were likely to lose the contest
for royal favor to the queen, mistresses, a clever valet, or other members of
the "court crowd." By occasional protests, reinforced by threats of resignation, Bismarck strove to isolate Wilhelm from "nonresponsible" advisers, but
he could never completely seal off bedchamber and antechamber from alien
influences. In his political thinking the function of parliament was to force
the ruler to depend upon ministers who publicly defended his policies. The
monarch must be constantly aware that the ministers could resign, if frustrated on an important issue, leaving him exposed as in 1862 to the attacks
of the chamber. They were his shield against pressures that might lead to
parliamentary government.3
Bismarck equated republicanism with parliamentary rule and monarchism

with the constitutional system of mixed powers. The last was for him the only
possible system of government in Germany. "Of all the experiments that have
taken place in the sphere of politics since Montesquieu and others," he declared in 1884, "the only truly useful result is the [concept of the separation
of powers] between the executive, legislature, and judiciary." Yet the three
branches were hardly equal in his constitutional thought. While acquiescing
in the use of the courts to discipline members of parliament and his own recalcitrant subordinates (for example, Harry von Arnim), he did not yield to
the judiciary the power to try impeached ministers under the "responsibility"
clauses of the Prussian and Reich constitutions. Nor did he concede to parliament full partnership with the monarchy in the business of government. In
the same speech of 1884—a time when his relationship with the Reichstag
was at a low ebb—he lectured the deputies on the "correct use" of power.
"The parliament should be able to prevent harm" by exercising its right to
"veto" impractical measures proposed by armchair bureaucrats. "It should be
able to prevent bad laws from being passed; it should be able to prevent the
waste of public money; but, gentlemen, it cannot govern."4 The function of
the legislature was to ward off evil rather than initiate good.
How was parliament to distinguish between what was harmful and what
was beneficial, what was to be opposed and what accepted? Bismarck considered himself, as a "man of state" beyond all partisan interest, to be the best
judge of what constituted the public welfare. It irritated him that many deputies, frequently a majority, were unwilling to accept him in this role, that
they tended to see in him a defender of special interests (the aristocracy, the
propertied classes, and especially the agrarians).5 As long as he was in power,
Bismarck could see no reason for parliament to exercise its power of prevention. When it did so in the 1860s and 1880s, he considered a coup d'etat to
revise the electoral base and change the composition of the chamber. But not
even this can be regarded as a departure from his belief that the essence of
constitutional monarchy was "the working together of the monarchical will
with the convictions of the governed population."6 Almost to the end of his
career Bismarck retained the conviction that at least 90 percent of the German people were monarchist in sympathy. The voting public had been misled
by demagogues, whose influence had to be excised by abolishing universal
male suffrage.7
In any conflict with parliament Bismarck believed that the monarch's will
must be decisive. The boundary line between monarchism and republicanism

would be crossed if the ruler were ever compelled by parliament "to do something that he could not willingly do." Yet in moments of extreme exasperation
Bismarck was capable of reflecting on the advantages of republicanism. WiIhelm's objections to the Dual Alliance in 1879 were, he believed, entirely
sentimental—sympathy for Russia, prejudice against Austria. "I know neither
hate nor fear nor love," the chancellor confided. "From the human standpoint
that would be laughable, but it is the way that states should be governed. . . .
After experiencing how difficult ruling monarchs make it for their ministers
to serve the country, one could almost become a republican." The man whom
he had borne on his shoulders to the throne now thought he knew everything
better than his minister and wanted to do it all himself. The huge fund of
royalism and veneration for the king with which he had assumed office, he
declared, was steadily declining.8
The English parliamentary system had a fascination for Bismarck, as it did
for most German liberals. But he contended that it could not be replicated.
"Until now it has not been proven in practice," he wrote in February 1870,
"that parliamentary government, as it developed in England during its long
and most unique history, can be naturalized in another large state, and it is
likewise an error to assume that a similar apparatus of elections, votes, and
caucuses could be employed elsewhere with the same lasting results as in England." He believed that parliamentary government in the English tradition
was only possible under certain conditions: "when an entire people is satisfied
with the essentials of an existing constitution, when the propertied and educated classes have long had a definite share in the powers of the state, when
the parties within those classes chiefly fight over which among them should
administer the whole and enjoy the advantages that come with that administration, when party leaders have learned how to govern and their party comrades how to let themselves be led." Even in England the sovereign and "governmental machine" together were, when a fundamental issue was at stake,
still decisive in determining who would form a cabinet—"not party traditions,
election platforms of the candidates, and votes in the lower chamber."9
By 1885 Bismarck had concluded that even in Britain the parliamentary
system was doomed. Its powerlessness had cost the monarchy "its hold on the
consciousness of the nation; the aristocracy, which replaced the monarchy in
the course of party struggles, has lost the majority . . . and can regain it only
in union or in alliance with radicals, who must be rewarded with antimonarchical concessions. The final consequence of such concessions is a republic;
the consequence of a republic in a large nation is necessarily civil war."10

reform bill—was genuine, and his comprehension of how it functioned more
accurate than that of most German students of the English system. Yet he
undoubtedly teased the deputies when he assured them at a parliamentary
soiree in March 1878 that the British system was his "ideal." "This system is
possible in England, where they have two large parties, but not here, where
seven or eight parties exist, all of them organized differently in different lawmaking bodies."11 At that moment he was plotting to split the National Liberal party.
Occasionally Bismarck spoke of the desirability of reshaping the party structure, molding political fragments into larger parties capable of supporting his
program. But his favorite tactic, that of providing for alternative majorities,
was divisive, for its success depended upon the multiplicity of parties as well
as parliaments. Domination of the Prussian Chamber of Deputies by a single
party in 1862-1866 had frustrated that tactic and presented him with the
greatest internal challenge of his career. The government's duty, as Bismarck
conceived it, was to "create a majority for itself in parliament."12 "We draw,
as the possibility presents itself, the diagonal of forces that are actually present," he told the deputies in 1870. "If one force becomes greater, then the
diagonal takes another direction."13 Only those parties that participated in
the government's majority could hope to influence its policy; attempts to coerce the government on a substantial issue were met by maneuvers to reconstitute the majority. Compromise, Bismarck was fond of saying, is the essence
of constitutional government. Yet the only compromises acceptable to him
on fundamental issues were those that yielded the appearance of concession
without the substance.
Bismarck was one of the most effective parliamentary speakers of his time,
although he disdained oratory and was suspicious of those who excelled at
it. I4 On his appearance tension mounted in the chamber. When he ordered a
mug of beer, the deputies knew he was getting ready to speak. As word spread,
they streamed from the halls and committee rooms to their seats.15 What they
heard was a thin, high-pitched voice that contrasted oddly with the massive
head and body. He groped for words, which came out in spurts but were usually on target. He was frequently witty, often sardonic and sarcastic, but rarely
dull.
Behind the scenes Bismarck was usually active in the interest of his legislative program, at least while he was in Berlin, conferring privately with important deputies, applying persuasion, pressure, and threats as he judged the
situation required. Prominent members were invited to formal dinners at the

chancellery. Health permitting, he held a weekly openhouse while parliament was in session. His guests at these soirees found him a jovial and considerate host, his table laden with food, wine, and the best Munich beer. Who
and how many attended—the number varied from twenty-five to five hundred—and what was said by him to whom was usually reported in the daily

of centrists in May 1879 the approaching end of the Kulturkampf.l6 In early
years there was a genuine exchange of opinion between him and his guests,

about his triumphs and others' follies. Wherever he stood or sat, a thick corona of deputies gathered, straining to hear what the great man had to say. If
he tarried in one room, the others emptied. Since he generally remained nowhere very long, the deputies were in constant motion, either following in
his wake or trying to anticipate where he would go next. "Everyone wanted
to warm himself in [Bismarck's] sun."17
Honoratioren Politics during the Early Empire
The fracturing of German political parties during the Bismarck period was in
part a reflection of the divisions in German society. Yet the history of modern
politics shows many examples of parties that have endured despite acute internal frictions, held together by common ideology, force of tradition, capacity for compromise, and the necessities of political competition. In Germany
these centripetal influences were not strong enough to withstand the pressures
that arose from Bismarck's successes in foreign policy and his exploitation of
them in domestic affairs. Earlier it has been shown that both the liberal and
conservative parties divided following the Prussian victory in 1866, the assumption by Prussia of the German national cause, passage of the indemnity
act, and drafting of the constitution of 1867.l8 Victory over France and the
completion of German unification led to the creation of the German Center
party to protect Catholic interests in a predominantly Protestant country.
It is true that the divisions of 1866-1867 did not for the time being liquidate the tradition of a single liberal and a single conservative party.I9 In the

* A Time for "Liberalism," 1 8 7 1 - 1 8 7 5 *

early years of the empire the term "party" had a dual meaning in the German
political vocabulary. In the broad sense it continued to mean the liberal and
conservative movements as a whole; in the narrow sense it meant the new
caucuses into which those general movements were divided within the
Reichstag and other parliaments. In parliament, in other words, the terms
party (Partei) and caucus (Fraktion) were used interchangeably (as they are in
these volumes). At election time candidates usually ran as "conservatives" or
"liberals" rather than as "Prussian conservatives," "free conservatives," "national liberals," and "progressives." As yet neither the party proper nor the
party caucus had a political organization extending down to the grass roots.
While the former was based upon an ideology or complex of ideas and feelings, the latter was based programmatically upon a "founding manifesto" and
successive "election manifestos" drafted by a central committee and detailing
the party's positions on major issues. Candidates were chosen by local committees or, in districts that were politically more advanced, by associations
(Vereine), both composed of prominent citizens sharing the general political
orientation of the party. The political composition of the local club or association tended to determine the political coloration of the candidate chosen
and hence the particular caucus in parliament he was likely to join if elected.
Because of this arrangement it was rare for conservative and free conservative candidates to oppose one another at the polls, and the two liberal parties
put up rival candidates for the same seat only in larger cities. (In the Reichstag
election of 1871, 13 districts had a single candidate, while 221 districts had
only two candidates.)20 On entering the chamber the newly elected member
decided which caucus best represented his brand of liberalism or conservatism. Since the political base of the deputy was in the local committee or
association, the caucus had difficulty enforcing party discipline. Leadership
was vested in a committee rather than a single individual, although one or
two persons in each caucus generally came—by virtue of personality, speaking
ability, or political sagacity—to be regarded as its chief spokesmen.
During the early years of the empire, the conservative and liberal parties
were still "parties of notables" (Honoratiorenparteien) rather than "parties of
the masses" (Massenparteien). Their elected representatives, like the committees and associations that chose the candidates, were men of local or national
prominence belonging to the bureaucratic, propertied, and intellectual
castes. The genus Honoratiorenpartei reflected an older society divided into
status and occupational groups with a recognized elite that was expected to

provide political leadership. Campaigning was often minimal—in northeastern rural districts dominated by the conservatives it was almost nonexistent.
But prominent national liberals, like Rudolf von Bennigsen, also rarely appeared in their constituencies at election time. Their claim to political leadership rested not on their "agitating skills" but on the deference owed them
because of their status. Such efforts as national liberals made to extend their
electoral base were aimed not at the newly enfranchised in the lowest social
stratum of the electorate but at the Mittektand, which most still regarded as
the only reservoir of informed political judgment in civil society.21 To Honoratioren the deputy, like the cabinet minister, was above politics. He was
chosen precisely because of his independence and freedom from contamination by special interests. In Max Weber's words, he lived "for" and not "off
politics."22 This was also Bismarck's view of the deputy's proper role, which
explains his irritation and even rage at "party particularism."
The elitist character of German politics was not unique in Europe. On the
contrary, French and English political parties had similar characteristics and
were to undergo a like transformation. The Honoratioren character of German
political leadership was reinforced by the constitution's prohibition against
compensation for service in parliament (repealed in 1906). In contrast to the
Prussian Chamber of Deputies, whose members were paid a per diem allowance of three (after 1873 five) thalers, Reichstag deputies had to support
themselves during the many months they spent in Berlin on public business.
Repeatedly the Reichstag passed and the Bundesrat rejected a bill providing
for per diem allowances. Bismarck was adamant in opposing any benefit other
than free railway passes (begun in 1873 and rescinded a decade later). He
hoped to keep professional politicians and working-class radicals out of the
chamber. In this he did not succeed. Many deputies for whom politics was the
primary calling made their living from occupations easily combined with it;
for example, journalist, lobbyist, and party official. Radical deputies of modest means were subsidized from party sources.23
Another factor influencing the composition of both the Reichstag and
Chamber of Deputies was the failure to reapportion electoral districts. Rural
areas became overrepresented and urban areas underrepresented in both parliaments. Under the constitution of 1871 the Reichstag represented "the entire population," its members chosen by universal, direct, and secret male
suffrage and unbound by instructions or commissions from constituents. Elec" Sheehan, "Political Leadership," p. 515, and German Liberalism, pp. 142-157. On the social

tion districts were distributed by state according to population, with 100,000
inhabitants and one deputy the norm for each district; small principalities
with fewer inhabitants were guaranteed at least one district. The periodic
expansion of the Reichstag to keep pace with population growth was to be
regulated by future legislation. But no such law was ever passed with the consequence that with time the Reichstag ceased to represent the "entire population" other than symbolically.24 The first Reichstag election of the German
Reich (in March i87t) should have functioned like a national plebiscite, but
only 52 percent of the electorate voted. In later German elections the turnout
hovered slightly above 60 percent (except for 1881—56.3 percent) until 1887
when it jumped to 77.5 percent. Prussia's suffrage was far more restrictive: a
three-class system, indirect election, oral voting, and election districts that
had not been reapportioned since they were established in 1849. Their unequal voice, the slowness of oral voting, and its social hazards kept most lower
class voters away from the polls. But even the upper classes were negligent.
In 1866, 27.6 percent of eligible voters in class I (low income), 47.5 percent
of class II (middle income), and 60.4 percent of class III (high income) cast
their ballots. The electoral colleges chosen in this way selected the deputies
by majority vote, a procedure that further reduced the chances of left-liberal
and socialist candidates.25
The failure to reapportion and the denial of remuneration to Reichstag
deputies buttressed Honoratioren politics for a time, but the dynamics of social
change eventually produced a new kind of politics. Industrialization, urbanization, and "flight from the land" broke down "the major clusters of old social, economic, and psychological commitments."26 New allegiances soon
arose more in accord with the German's altered perceptions of his needs. Simultaneously demographic concentration, faster communication, mass education, and mass journalism opened the way for new kinds of political agitation. A few perceptive individuals (most notably, Hermann Wagener among
the conservatives and Hefmann Schulze-Delitzsch among the liberals) were
already trying—without much success—to convince their colleagues of the
need to politicize the lower classes through the nurture of their material interests. Not until the Center and Social Democratic parties (the first Massenparteien) had established themselves and survived the assaults of Bismarck and

the older parties was it fully realized that universal male suffrage and social
change required a different kind of politics.
Occupational statistics show that in the 1870s Germany's most important
elected bodies were still dominated by the old agrarian and bureaucratic elites,
despite annexations, unification, and industrialization. Of 484 members of
the Prussian Chamber of Deputies during 1870-1873, 170 (35 percent) were
state officials, including 76 belonging to the judiciary, and 129 (26.7 percent)
were landowners (whether farmers or estate owners, small or large landowners
is undetermined). In addition, there were 19 (4 percent) retired state officials
and 6 army officers, along with 30 (6.2 percent) local officials, 21 (4.3 percent) educators and 21 pastors (including 17 Catholics). The chamber contained 34 (7 percent) businessmen and rentiers, 21 (4.3 percent) lawyers, 8
journalists, and 3 physicians; 151 persons (31.2 percent) were noblemen, including 21 barons, 19 counts, and 3 princes. Three members listed themselves
as "independent workers."27 Of 384 deputies in the first German Reichstag
(1871-1873), 97 (25.3 percent) were state officials, including 45 from the
judiciary, and 104 (27.1 percent) were landowners, including 80 big estate
owners, 22 estate owners, and 2 small farmers. Retired state officials and army
officers numbered 20 (5.2 percent), local officials 11 (2.9 percent), educators
29 (7.5 percent), pastors 13 (3.4 percent). Forty-five (11.7 percent) lawyers
and 30 (7.8 percent) businessmen (17 merchants and 13 industrialists) were
elected. In the Reichstag sat one artisan and no factory workers.28
In the Prussian election of November 1870 the parties of the right suffered
minor losses, conservatives electing 114 deputies as against 125 in 1867, free
conservatives 41 as against 48, the old-liberals n as against 15. The national
liberals grew from 99 to 123, the progressives from 48 to 49. The Reichstag,
whose election was delayed by the war until March 1871, was larger (384
instead of 297) owing to the inclusion of the south. Here the two right-wing
parties suffered a decline in numerical as well as relative strength, the conservatives sinking from 64 to 57, the free conservatives rising only from 34 to
37. The major gainers from the expansion were the national liberals (from 78
to 125) and progressives (from 29 to 46). Although the old-liberal caucus had
disappeared, its place was taken by a new and short-lived Liberal Reich party,
composed of about 30 members, mostly statesmen of the lesser states. Both
elections were notable for the appearance in significant numbers of a new
Catholic party, the Center, with 58 members in the Chamber of Deputies
and 61 in the Reichstag.29

ers were concentrated in the Conservative and Free Conservative parties,
which they dominated overwhelmingly. Despite differences in attitude toward the revolution Bismarck had effected, both parties were closely linked
to the old Prussian establishment—monarchy, army, bureaucracy, Protestant
church, nobility, and agrarian landlords. The National Liberal party, generally believed to have been the spokesman for big business, was composed of
deputies with a wide range of occupations—estate owners, officials, judges,
city officials, professors, lawyers, businessmen. Each of these groups was modest in size when compared to the total strength of the party. In 1871-1873
the Reichstag caucus, for example, had only fifteen deputies who identified
themselves as businessmen (three industrialists, two bankers, six merchants,
two insurers, one shipper, and one publisher), as against sixteen judges, seventeen lawyers, and five writers. The Reichstag caucus of the Progressive
party, often considered to have been the spokesman for mercantile interests
and light industry, contained three merchants, two factory owners, and one
railway director, compared to nine professors, seven estate owners, seven lawyers, four city officials, four jurists, and three writers. The first Reichstag caucus of the Center party showed the wide distribution of listed occupations to
be expected of a party created primarily for the protection of Catholic interests. The largest groups were seventeen estate owners (big and small in almost
equal numbers), twelve priests, nine lawyers, nine officials (five retired), and
twelve judges (four retired).30
On the basis of listed occupations it is impossible to explain why so many
statutes of the period 1867-1878 favored the interests and growth of industrial
capitalism. Certainly the commitment of the deputies, particularly of the national liberals, to business interests has been exaggerated in recent historical
works.31 But it is also true that the occupations they claimed often reflected
the social status deputies preferred more than the character of their financial
involvement—a factor often difficult to trace.3i Nor does a listing such as
"factory owner" reveal the amount of capital invested and what other interlocking financial and managerial commitments it may have produced. After
the crash of 1873 the German public, fed by denunciations from the press,
became more conscious of the frequency with which the names of certain
deputies, particularly those of high title, appeared on the boards and founding
committees of corporate enterprises. According to one, admittedly hostile,
source, 62 members of the Prussian House of Lords, 90 members of the Cham30

ber of Deputies, and 105 members of the Reichstag were involved in varying
degrees in the great corporate boom of the early 1870s.33
To assume, however, that deputies who happened to be bankers, industrialists, merchants, or estate owners "represented" those business interests in
the chamber is rather misleading.34 If their attitudes and votes were predictable on tax and other economic legislation, most of the important bills before
the Prussian and German parliaments in these years dealt with other matters.
Consider, for example, the long debates on capital punishment in the Reichstag in r870 and the Kulturkampf laws of the next decade in both the Reichstag and Chamber of Deputies. Nor was the tradition that deputies were chosen to represent the nation rather than constituencies of no consequence. In
their interpretation of that ethic, the deputies were probably no more free of
cant and self-delusion than is common in all human affairs. The ranks of the
free conservatives, national liberals, and progressives were filled with men
who, whether or not they were in business, approved the rush toward modernity that industrialization offered and assumed that what was good for business
was also good for the country. For most of them German national unity, material progress, and laissez-faire served moral as well as material ends. Idealism
and self-interest are not always opposed, and politicians are happiest when
they coincide.
The Dynamics of Party Politics
The material explanation of political behavior fails, moreover, to take into
account the dynamics of the power struggle in a parliamentary system. In a
multiparty system many other factors can influence or determine party behavior: for example, relative size and position in the political spectrum; skill in
fashioning compromises; bargaining at election time; hunger for participation
in a winning coalition; and the search for viable majority capable of enduring
brief crises for long-term objectives. A constitution of mixed powers, furthermore, frees neither the government nor the parties from concern over their
mutual relationship. The desire to maintain or establish contact with the government can be a powerful influence on party conduct. Consider, for example, how the participants in the struggle over the tariff act of 1879 explained
their actions. Baron Georg von Franckenstein, the centrist deputy who fashioned the compromise that eased passage of the statute, said afterward "that
his motion was based on a question of power and that the Center party had
allied with the conservatives simply for the purpose of forcing the National
Liberal party out of its relationship with the government and ripping away its

previous influence. . . . To choose the lesser of two unavoidable evils is to do
nothing more than to act according to the cardinal virtue of Christian wisdom."35 Eduard Lasker, on the other hand, judged that national liberals gave
up their resistance to the bill "purely out of tactical considerations: because
the momentary current in the population was favorable to the indicated direction and was extraordinarily strengthened by the mighty influence of
Prince Bismarck; because the Center party was ready for an alliance with the
government, thereby securing a majority; and because persistence in the minority under such circumstances did not appear to be in the party's interest.
The same considerations, I fear, will lead to the same result whenever Prince
Bismarck sets the game of party politics in motion similarly in any other political area."36
For a decade after 1867 the National Liberal party held the key position in
the Reichstag—a result less of its size than of its location in the constellation
of political forces in the chamber. Situated in the center of a polarized body,
the caucus had the capability of producing majorities by combining either
with the left or the right. Only four of the original twenty-four schismatics
who had left the Progressive party in September 1866 were still in the Reichstag after 1871, along with a few other former progressives who had joined
them in the following year to found the National Liberal party. The party was
now overwhelmingly composed of deputies who had not participated in the
constitutional conflict—"old-liberals" who had their own caucus until 1870
and newcomers from the regions annexed by Prussia in 1866 and from the
lesser states north and south of the Main. This influx had greatly strengthened
the right wing at the cost of the left.37 After the departure of Karl Twesten
from politics in July 1870 ("with a shattered arm, loss of position and income,
completely eroded in health—without having attained or influenced anything
whatever"),38 leadership of the left fell to Eduard Lasker. A lawyer and journalist, Lasker possessed a sharp intellect, boundless energy, and total dedication to politics; he was one of the most able and feared debaters in parliament.
Also prominent on the left were Max von Forckenbeck (mayor of Breslau,
later of Berlin), Baron Franz Schenk von Stauffenberg (a Bavarian landowner), Hans Victor von Unruh (railway entrepreneur), and Ludwig Bamberger (banker and journalist). The most important leaders of the right wing
were two veteran leaders of the old Nationalverein, Rudolf von Bennigsen
and Johannes Miquel, both new-Prussians from Hanover. Bennigsen was a
noble landowner, lawyer, and judge, who through political prominence had
become involved in the founding of the Hanover-Altenbecken railway com35

pany, which collapsed in 1874—one of the doomed ventures of "railway
baron" Bethel Henry Strousberg. For Miquel politics was good business.
Trained in law, he became mayor of Osnabriick, later of Frankfurt am Main,
and was deeply involved after 1869 in the affairs of the Disconto-Gesellschaft,
including the founding of new railway and banking companies. Also prominent on the right wing were Wilhelm Wehrenpfennig (journalist and after
1879 counselor in the Kultusmimsterium), Eduard Stephani (lawyer and municipal deputy in Leipzig), and Karl Braun (Wiesbaden lawyer, writer and
journalist, and businessman).39
During the period of the North German Confederation there was little difference in the basic objectives of right and left wings of the National Liberal
party, despite occasional conflicts over tactics and immediate goals. Miquel
was no less forthright than Lasker in pressing for "development" of the constitution. Bennigsen, on the other hand, was a moderate by temperament. He
became the dominant figure in the party as a whole through his capacity for
patient negotiation and skillful compromise. Despite the stark contrast in
their backgrounds, Bennigsen, the Protestant nobleman, and Lasker, the Jewish bourgeois, established a close relationship after 1870. While sharing the
common ideals of liberalism and nationalism, they differed in emphasis. Bennigsen was the "idealist of the Nationaktaat," Lasker the "idealist of the
Rechtsstaat." "They represented once more the two sides of the old double
ideal: the unity and freedom of the nation." In the two wings of the National
Liberal party can again be seen the conflicting claims of the Hegelian and
humanistic traditions of German idealistic philosophy. To the right wing, the
best guarantee for freedom and cultural progress was to be found in the power
and independence of the state; to the left wing, it was to be found in civil
liberty and parliamentary power.40 Paradoxically, the internal cleavage of the
National Liberal party, ultimately fatal for its unity, gave it a pivotal position
in parliament, able through its left wing to combine with the progressives on
liberal issues or through its right wing with the free conservatives and the
Liberal Reich party.
In spirit the Progressive party remained true to the ideals for which it had
fought during the constitutional conflict and which in its view the national

liberals had betrayed by accepting the indemnity bill and the constitution of
1867. More than half of the progressives elected to the Reichstag in 1871
were Prussian, many of them veterans of the conflict years. The party regularly captured the six seats allotted to Berlin and four seats in the East Prussian
district of Gumbinnen, which had once been the nucleus of the party. One
of the latter was Baron Leopold von Hoverbeck (estate owner and judge),
who remained the party's dominant figure until his death in 1875. Hoverbeck
remained true to the conviction he had expressed early in his political career
that it was "better to do nothing than to do something wrong." National
liberals, he believed, were permitting themselves to be exploited by Bismarck,
who would eventually return to a conservative course. Yet he avoided severing the connection with the National Liberal party. His death and the defection of Wilhelm Lowe-Kalbe (physician with conjugal connections to heavy
industry) weakened the moderate wing of the Progressive party at the end of
the 1870s. Leadership of the "committed liberals," as they called themselves,
then passed to Albert Hanel (political scientist at Kiel University) and Eugen
Richter (journalist). The more radical was Richter, whose personal ascendancy in the party eventually amounted to near dictatorship. Under his leadership the progressives adopted in December 1876 a party platform calling for
parliamentary government, the most extreme demand yet advanced by any
major political party. Richter's rigorous scrutiny of the budget and other fiscal
legislation in search of hidden expenditures and irregular procedures became
legendary.41
While willing to support some liberal aims, such as limited improvement
in parliament's budget rights and creation of an imperial cabinet, the free
conservatives were essentially a "government" or "Bismarck party." Many of
its members were closely associated with the chancellor (Keudell, Lucius,
Friedenthal), while others had close connections at court (Prince of Pless,
Duke of Ujest, Count Miinster). On election to the Reichstag Bismarck's own
sons, Wilhelm and Herbert, became free conservatives. The party had many
prominent members, but no definite leaders, unless they were Count Eduard
von Bethusy-Huc (Landrat) and Wilhelm von Kardorff (estate owner and industrialist). Geographically the centers of free conservative strength were in
Silesia and the Rhineland. The Liberal Reich party was distinguishable from
the Free Conservative party chiefly because of its strong emphasis upon federalism. The caucus came into existence in March 1871 and expired in 1874.

Increasingly isolated on the right of the chamber was the Conservative
party. The "old conservatives," as they were called, failed in their aspiration
to become a national party in the Reichstag elections. Almost all of the deputies were from Prussia, the great majority from rural Brandenburg, Pomerania, and East Prussia. At election time the great landowners made resolute
use of their local economic and political dominance to shut out the opposition. The dependence of local pastors, schoolteachers, and innkeepers upon
them enabled estate owners and county officials (the Landrat was often the
conservative candidate) to dominate public opinion. Secrecy of the ballot was
poorly maintained, and the peasantry voted as they were told. Good speakers
and effective politicians were rare among the conservatives. Accustomed to a
privileged position in government, they found it difficult to adjust to the new
era of parliamentary politics. Two who did were Moritz von Blanckenburg
(Pomeranian landowner and Landrat) and Hermann Wagener (journalist,
state official, and railway "founder"). The "old conservative" movement operated on three fronts: Reichstag, Chamber of Deputies, and House of Lords.
Its strength mounted in each chamber; in the third it was dominant. The
conservative members in the first two chambers were not identical, nor were
their politics. Albeit reluctantly, Reichstag conservatives were inclined to
accept German unification. Believing that Prussian particularism was a lost
cause, they advocated Prussianization of the national government by adoption in the Reich of a cabinet system on the Prussian model and conversion
of the Bundesrat into a Prussian-style House of Lords. Those who sat in the
Landtag, on the other hand, were increasingly inclined toward resistance to
centralization and to revolt against Bismarck and his policy of collaboration
with national liberals.43
The most dramatic event of the 1870-1871 elections was the emergence of
a Catholic party, the Center, as the second strongest caucus in the Reichstag.
Although Catholics had representation earlier in both chambers (dating back
to the 1850s in the Chamber of Deputies), the Center party was a new phenomenon. It was the product of a popular religious revival in German Catholicism that began in the 1850s; fears for the faith engendered by smallGerman unification under Protestant leadership; the advantages of universal

and equal male suffrage; agitation by the priesthood under orders from the
bishops; and an effective network of local, regional, and national organizations. In March 1871 fifty-eight centrist deputies were elected to the Reichstag, of which thirty-six came from Prussian constituencies, twenty-one of
them located in the Rhineland. Eighteen deputies stemmed from Bavaria. No
other caucus had so broad a social and electoral base: poor and well-to-do
peasants, factory and mine workers, all middle-class strata, and wealthy landowners, including many aristocrats.
The emergence of the Center threatened the previous outlines of German
politics and created for a time a climate of uncertainty in both chambers.
Party program and leadership were conservative, stressing particularly the virtues of federalism. The vital question was whether the Center would ally with
conservatives to create a new bloc in the chamber. It will be shown, however,
that its first actions isolated the Center in the Reichstag and relieved the
anxiety of the old middle parties. For a time the Center could be discounted
as a factor in the parliamentary balance of power. Increasingly dominant in
the party by virtue of his debating and tactical skills was Ludwig Windthorst,
a lawyer, former minister of Hanover, and vigorous supporter of the rights of
the deposed King Georg. Other luminaries were the brothers August and Peter Reichensperger, the former president of the Cologne city council, the latter a superior court judge (Obertribuncdsrat) in Berlin, and Hermann von MaIlinckrodt, a Westphalian estate owner.44
The Liberal Challenge, 1871-1873
From the political standpoint Bismarck's task of consolidating the German
Reich was twofold. On the one hand, the empire had to be welded together
by new laws and institutions that served concrete needs of the population. To
this end the Reichstag had to become the most important arena of German
politics and within it a "diagonal of forces" had to be found among parties of
national and liberal viewpoint. On the other hand, it was necessary to solidify
the federal system of mixed powers and the aristocratic-monarchical order
that the system was designed to protect. Paradoxically, success in the first of
these dual enterprises jeopardized the second. Centralization was a threat to
federalism as well as particularism, and the destruction of federalism would
have upset the institutional equilibrium that was the essence of Bismarckian
government, leaving crown and chancellor face to face with parliament. The

obvious goal of the liberal parties was to make themselves indispensable to
the chancellor and thereby exact a price for his dependency. Would his need
of their support force him to yield a significant redistribution of power under
the Prussian and German constitutions? If so, the day might come, by evolution if not by design, when the parliamentary majority would form the executive, rather than the reverse. Or could Bismarck appease the deputies by
paying "blackmail" only in the less vital areas of civil liberties and economic
freedom?
Earlier it has been shown that the Reichstag of 1867-1870 was hardly docile.45 Neither liberals nor conservatives were content to be the mere instrument of Bismarck's policy. Repeated attempts were made by the former to
regain some of the ground lost in the compromises of the constituent Reichstag. Liberal deputies found great satisfaction in strengthening the unitary aspect of the governmental structure (in cooperation with Bismarck and DeIbriick); they did succeed in strengthening civil liberties (most notably in
modernizing the criminal code); but they were sharply rebuffed in their efforts
to "build out" the constitution by adding to the powers of the legislature at
the cost of the executive. Each failure led the liberals to look forward all the
more to the elections of 1870 and the reviewal of the iron budget in 1871.
Bismarck was to be confronted with the necessity of deciding whether to purchase the continued cooperation of the liberal parties by a significant enlargement of parliamentary budget rights and a fundamental reorganization of the
confederate executive (an objective that had support, although for different
reasons, in both conservative parties). Whether they would have been any
more successful in this contest than they were during 1862-1866 is doubtful.
Yet it is unquestionable that the inclination to make the challenge extended
throughout the liberal front, although in differing degree.
Once again, as in 1866, a dramatically successful military campaign and a
fresh anointment of the Prussian establishment with the moral unction of
German nationalism frustrated the aspirations of liberal deputies for a greater
influence in government. The revision that did occur in late 1870 was one
that strengthened the federal rather than the unitary and parliamentary side
of the constitutional structure. His talks with southern statesmen and politicians in September 1870finallyconvinced even Lasker, the liberal leader who
was most active in 1870 in trying to shape Germany's future, that the problems of bringing the southern states into the union precluded any attempt to
liberalize or centralize the constitution.46 Ultimately the national liberals
were compelled to surrender even the lingering hope for a constitutional
amendment committing the Reich to future legislation establishing the judicial responsibility of ministers. In the final debates and negotiations of November 1870 the great issue was what concessions had to be made to partic45

ularism, not liberalism. The only influence liberals could exert on the final
outcome was as a pressure group mobilized by Bismarck against lingering resistance in Bavaria and Wiirttemberg.
Northern liberals had always presumed that the completion of German unification would present them with the opportunity, in alliance with their
southern counterparts, to reopen the basic issues of constitutionalism. Yet
only a small group of deputies (chiefly progressives and socialists) voted
against the treaties with the south that established the Reich constitution.47
For right-wing liberals disappointment over the outcome was far outweighed
by exultation over the final attainment of a German national state. Heinrich
von Sybel expressed the general euphoria in a letter to Hermann Baumgarten,
written soon after the Kaiser proclamation at Versailles. "How have we deserved God's grace to be permitted to experience such great and mighty
things? And for what shall one live hereafter? That which has been for twenty
years the object of all our wishes and efforts has now been achieved in such a
bounteous, wonderful way. Where shall I at my age find a new purpose for
living?"48 Not every liberal, however, was convinced that nothing remained
to be striven for. Still alive was the thought that Lasker had inscribed in the
founding program of 1867: "The German state and German freedom must be
won simultaneously with the same means. . . . Every step toward constitutional unity is also progress in the realm of freedom, or bears the impulse
toward such progress within itself."49
Soon after the first Reichstag of the German Reich convened Bismarck got
a chance to gauge the chamber's temper—and vice versa. In May 1871 two
veteran employees of the imperial postal service at Hamburg petitioned the
Reichstag in behalf of their colleagues on a matter of wages and were abruptly
transferred to remote posts in East Prussia. In reply to an interpellation of the
progressives, Delbriick refused any explanation, denying the right of parliament to interfere in affairs of the executive branch. The consequence was
that national liberals also became alarmed over this act of "bureaucratic despotism"; they too regarded the act of petition as a fundamental right of the
citizen. Southern liberals, reflected Julius Holder (Wiirttemberg), were "unaccustomed to this manner of conduct by a minister"; he doubted that they
would be able to tolerate it for long. "We cannot sacrifice constitutional rights
just for Bismarck's sake." Bismarck saw the matter differently. "The Reichstag," he remarked to Lucius, "regards the government like a snarling dog."5°

During May 1871 the Reichstag deliberated on a bill formally uniting Al­
sace-Lorraine with the German Reich. The government bill provided for a
period of dictatorship to last until January 1, 1874, when the Reich consti­
tution was to go into effect. Meanwhile, the Kaiser, acting through the chan­
cellor, was to exercise the executive power, and the Bundesrat the legislative
power. The Reichstag would have had no voice. In explaining the bill to the
deputies on May 2, Bismarck seemed to invite amendments, urging the dep­
uties to "have the courage to shape the future." The allied governments, he
declared, were willing "to let themselves be taught, if we receive a better
proposal of any kind." The liberals took him at his word, amending the bill
to terminate the dictatorship on January 1, 1873, and to require Reichstag
approval of any loans or fiscal guarantees incurred for Alsace-Lorraine. The
latter amendment, introduced by Lasker and Stauffenberg, received the sup­
port of progressives, national liberals, members of the Liberal Reich party,
and prominent free conservatives—a combination that produced something
of a sensation. Echoing through the discussion was the old concern over ex­
cessive concentration of authority under the chancellor and the desire for an
imperial cabinet. Even Treitschke protested: "It exceeds the strength of one
individual, to perform simultaneously the functions of an imperial chancellor
and of a regent for Alsace."51
Returning to the chamber on May 25, 1871, after an absence of more than
three weeks, Bismarck denounced the Lasker-Stauffenberg amendment as a
"painful" attack on his personal integrity. "I am represented to the country as
a frivolous contractor of debts." 52 Prince Chlodwig zu Hohenlohe-Schillingsfiirst, a deputy from Bavaria and member of the Liberal Reich party, expressed
the general consternation when he wrote in his diary that, while it was absurd
for the Reichstag to give the chancellor a vote of no confidence on such an
issue, Bismarck was presumptuous to expect the chamber to reverse itself
merely because, after three weeks of silence, he had finally made his objec­
tions known. The centrists and progressives (who had argued for more radical
amendments) wished to force the issue and were joined by some national
liberals. But the matter was referred back to committee by a narrow margin.
Bismarck appeared there, "at first very surly," according to Hohenlohe, but
was handled with such finesse that in the end he "quite forgot why he had got
angry." A compromise required Reichstag approval only for fiscal obligations
that "burdened the Reich." 53

sitivity on matters that concerned his own prerogatives, but also his alarm
over the appearance of a coalition of the four middle parties interested in
protecting parliamentary power. In late May 1871 the same formidable combination proposed to allocate part of the French war indemnity for the aid of
needy veterans of the reserve and Landwehr; Bismarck regarded the measures
as an invasion of the Kaiser's prerogatives in military affairs; yet he felt compelled to accept it rather than face trouble with the Reichstag over a government bill that distributed part of the French Mittiarden to the generals in the
form of dotations. "The gentlemen are starting to get troublesome," he commented to Count Waldersee. "The temptation to want to govern some also is
altogether too great; those flat-headed free conservatives stand out in this
regard."54
In the fall of 1871 the Reichstag finally faced the issue awaited by "committed liberals" since 1867—the military budget. But now the circumstances
were, as Forckenbeck saw it, "the most unfortunate conceivable." The defeat
of France had not only heightened the prestige of the military; it had also left
the Germans with a sense of isolation in Europe, of being surrounded by defeated enemies and envious powers eager to reverse the results of the wars of
unification. How radically the climate had changed was evident on November 6 when the deputies voted 170 to 121 (centrists, progressives, and left
wing of the national liberals in the negative) to accept a government bill
allocating 40,000,000 thalers from the French war indemnity for a Reich war
chest without reserving for the Reichstag any control over its use or increase.
Forckenbeck could not even recall that in late 1866 he had taken a contrary
position with regard to the creation of a Prussian war chest.55
The proposed imperial budget for 1872 reached the Reichstag in November
1871, less than two months before it was to go into effect. Of total expenditures amounting to about 117,000,000 thalers, nearly 90,000,000 were destined for the army. The latter sum was requested as a lump sum (,Pauschquanturn), leaving undefined the specific military purposes for which it was to be
spent. In view of the short time left for consideration and the fact that German troops still remained in France, there was little dissent about the lumpsum feature of the bill. What the deputies objected to was the amount, which
represented an increase over the 225 thalers per soldier set in the constitution. By insisting on the old rate, national liberals wished to save 1,421,000
thalers; the progressives advocated a much larger economy (6,200,000 thalers), to be gained by reducing the length of military service from three to two
years. ' 6

Once again the government and parliament in Berlin faced the prospect of
conflict over the critical question of the chamber's budgetary power in military affairs. The conflict that ensued, however, was not between the executive and legislative branches, but between the wings of the National Liberal
party. The opposing fronts dissolved and reformed over a proposal advanced
by the free conservative Bethusy-Huc—acting in behalf of Bismarck, Roon,
and the Prussian cabinet—that accepted the reduced amount desired by the
national liberals in return for a renewal of the iron budget for three years.
Bismarck wished to postpone for the time being conflicts with the Reichstag
over "great issues of principle," while Roon liked the lump-sum provision
which left him unrestricted in allocating money.57 Conservatives and free
conservatives followed the government in accepting Bethusy-Huc's motion,
while progressives and centrists were adamantly opposed. The split went
down the middle of the chamber, dividing both the Liberal Reich and National Liberal parties, particularly the latter.
The critical caucus of the National Liberal party occurred on November 26, 1871. Many deputies evaded the problem by staying away. Those
who came heard an impassioned debate, chiefly between Bennigsen and
Forckenbeck, who were for the compromise, and Lasker, Stauffenberg, and
Bamberger, who were against it. The majority sided with Bennigsen and
Forckenbeck, 46 to 25. So sharp was the disagreement, so acrimonious the
atmosphere that the party appeared on the verge of dissolution.58 On November 29 the polemic spilled over on to the floor of the Reichstag. Treitschke
defended the iron budget as the palladium of parliamentary freedom; Germany had never been more free than under the North German Confederation
whose parliament had not debated the military budget. "Naked absolutism,"
Lasker replied, was preferable to "sham constitutionalism"; if the three-year
budget were adopted, Germany would be one-fifth constitutional state, fourfifths military dictatorship. After a futile attempt at compromise (a two-year
military budget), the national liberals split in the decisive vote: 51 voting in
the majority of 152 for the three-year budget, 44 in the minority of 128
against it.59

and temperament and by generating personal animosities not easily forgotten,
presaged the split that clove it apart a decade later. The most significant aspect of the affair was the revelation that the party holding the pivotal position
could not exploit it to consolidate parliamentary power. No other area was so
critical for such consolidation as that of annual control over the budget. By
chance the Reichstag had found in the state assessments (Matrikuhrbeitrage)
a means with which to control the income side of the fiscal ledger, but control
over outgo would never be secure until the parliament possessed the right
annually to approve military expenditures item by item. Had they been willing to accept the increase in the rate of military expenditures proposed by the
government for 1872, the national liberals might at least have established a
precedent for annual control upon which they could have built in the following year. What they actually did was to confirm the precedent established in
1867; thereafter, the iron budget became a permanent feature of public finance in the German Reich.
While standing firm on this major issue, Bismarck yielded on another of
significance to liberals. In the final stages of their deliberations on the imperial budget for 1872, the national liberals sponsored a resolution calling upon
the government to present a bill in the next session creating an imperial
agency to audit government revenues and expenditures for their conformity
to law. Under the confederate constitution this obligation had fallen to the
Prussian superior accounting office (Oberrechnungskammer), whose deficiencies had long been a source of irritation to liberal critics. During the constitutional conflict of the 1860s the office had presented no obstacle to the government's willingness to rule without a legislated budget. The bill drafted by
the chancellor's office and presented to the Reichstag in the session of 1872
would have created for the Reich a mere replica of it. In the chamber Lasker
sponsored amendments intended to give the new auditing agency some teeth.
One of them required that reports from the Reich's superior accounting office
concerning the revenues and expenditures of the imperial government be presented to the Bundesrat and Reichstag "for their examination and approval."
This amendment, which the government accepted, gave to the Reichstag a
role in reviewing and approving the government'sfiscalperformance, a power
that the Prussian Chamber of Deputies had never possessed.60
While this concession was not insignificant, the major redistribution of
political power effected by Reichstag of 1871-1873 altered the relationship
not between the executive and parliament but between the Reich and the
German states. Here the national liberals shared the basic objective of the
chancellor, that of consolidating the Reich. More than thirty laws of the
North German Confederation became imperial statutes. New laws of unitary

import were passed, the most important of which was the introduction of a
new coinage based on the gold standard. The mark replaced the thaler as the
new unit of currency, bearing on one side the imperial eagle and on the reverse the image of the ruler of the issuing state. 6 ' The constitution was
amended three times: the provision for itio in partes was abolished; the legislative power of the Reich was extended to include certain maritime affairs and
"the entire civil law." The latter amendment, stemming from an initiative
taken by Lasker, met considerable opposition among the medium states of the
south, which was only overcome with Bismarck's support. Like the liberal
parties, the chancellor felt that common courts and common codes of law
were particularly important for the work of consolidation.62 Bismarck was
chiefly responsible, however, for the defeat of another constitutional amendment that would have compelled state governments to modernize their constitutions by introducing popularly elected assemblies. Initiated by the liberal
parties in the Reichstag, the amendment, which gained some support in the
Bundesrat, was aimed at the two principalities of Mecklenburg, whose diets
were based on a system of corporative representation that dated back to the
Middle Ages. But here Bismarck drew the line, arguing for states' rights and
preservation of the federal system.63
Collaboration with Bismarck, the liberal deputies learned, could only be
on his terms. In the spring of 1872 Eduard Brockhaus wrote in his diary: "He
is said to have renewed his old lament: the national liberals demanded that
he go with them, and he had verily done just that; but the national liberals
did not reciprocate, did not behave like a government party should, etc. Yet
he also shares the blame, which as a consequence lies on both sides. . . .
Stephani said recently that he believes Bismarck will soon give us another
'kick,' in order to keep us from becoming too powerful and because his whole
policy consists in never depending on any one party for support, but in holding each in check with another, making a protege of first one, then another.
I am not entirely of this opinion, but there is certainly some truth in it."64
During the legislative period 1871-1873 German liberals failed, once
again, to press the issue of parliamentary power. The reasons were many. Bismarck's accumulated successes in diplomacy and war had so heightened his
prestige that the deputies were even more reluctant to cross him than they
had been during 1867-1870. Furthermore, their collaboration with him was
producing in other areas legislation that corresponded with their ideas and
interests. But the most persuasive reason of all for being unaggressive was the

fact that Bismarck and the liberals became deeply engaged after 1871 in a
common struggle against German Catholicism. The liberals permitted themselves to be drawn into an attack upon the right of the Catholic minority to
organize politically and of the Catholic church to conduct its affairs without
interference from the state. It was a struggle from which Bismarck, the practitioner of RealpoUtik, could extricate himself without damage to his Weltari'
schauung, but from which the liberals, who had long preached the cause of
civil liberty, could only emerge badly compromised.

The Kulturkampf
}<^^^^ι URING the 1870s Bismarck suffered thefirstsignificant defeat of his
CA^cVfy political career when he failed to liquidate Catholicism as a major
w j T ^ l J force in German politics. His attack upon political Catholicism bevlA_J came an assault on the Catholic church; this aspect of the affair
gave it the popular title of Kulturkampf ("struggle for culture"), a polemical
term invented not by Bismarck but by his liberal allies. The Kulturkampf was
a kaleidoscope, altering its shape with each angle of observation. It can be
seen as a conflict between church and state, Catholic doctrine and German
idealism, faith and materialism, conservatism and liberalism, traditionalism
and modernism, universalism and nationalism, particularism and consolida­
tion. In most of these aspects the Kulturkampf was not merely a Prussian but
also a German and even European phenomenon. Even without Bismarck,
Prussia and Germany would have been affected by it to some degree. Yet he
made the decisions that launched the nationwide struggle in Germany. While
not responsible for all that happened, he set the course that others were only
too glad to follow.
Paradoxically the Kulturkampf resulted from a collision between two forces,
both of which acted defensively in purpose, but offensively in practice. On
the one hand, the Vatican, threatened by the advance of liberal modernism
and the growth of nation-states, sought to strengthen its spiritual authority
through the Syllabus of Errors and the doctrine of papal infallibility. Cut off
from Austria as a consequence of the war of 1866 and finding themselves a
minority in what was generally regarded as a "Protestant state," German
Catholics organized for the purpose of protecting their values and interests
through the political process. Bismarck, on the other hand, was affected by a
sense of insecurity typical of successful revolutionaries, even conservative
ones. What had been created by violence had to be protected by coercion
until consolidated by laws and institutions and legitimated by time and the
development of a moral consensus. By early 1870 he was deeply concerned
about the "Polonization" of Germans in eastern Prussia and about the role of
Catholic clergy in cultivating Polish separatism. To him the founding of the
Center party was further evidence of a Catholic "mobilization against the
state." 1 To most Catholics the state's defense against that "mobilization"
looked like an assault on freedom of faith and an assertion of the omnipotence
of the state.

In the case of liberal nationalism, the third force involved in the KuIturkampf, the offensive motivation clearly predominated. Natiorudstaat,
Rechtsstaat, Machtstaat, and Kulturstaat were for German liberals simultaneous
goals. The attainment of a national state, the advance of civil liberties, the
sharing of political power with the bureaucratic state, the realization of the
power-state through three victorious wars fought for an ideal cause were logically linked to the quest for that other, peculiarly German, liberal ideal—the
"culture state," that is, a state separated from the church and freed from clerical influence, yet harnessed for the achievement of secular cultural objectives
such as the advancement of education, promotion of science, and cultivation
of the arts. For liberal nationalists, Lutheran Protestantism and German idealism were the sources of Germany's moral and intellectual greatness, while
Roman Catholicism was an alien force, hostile to the sovereign state and an
impediment to the spiritual unity of the nation. To persons of this conviction
the Kulturkampf was a logical extension of the wars of 1864, 1866, and 1870.
Following the expulsions of Denmark, Austria, and France, ultramontanism
was to be ousted from Germany's soil and soul. Until this was accomplished,
the work of liberation and unification would remain incomplete.2

Background of the Struggle
During the nineteenth century the Catholic church was confronted with the
problem of adapting to a rapidly changing society. Temporarily buoyed by
Romanticism and the religious revival early in the century, the church was
soon washed by other currents that threatened to erode both its faith and
institutional structure. The secularization of church property under both absolutism and revolution weakened its finances. The centralized, bureaucratic
state jeopardized its control over the ecclesiastical hierarchy. New ideologies^—liberalism, democracy, nationalism, socialism—competed with religion
for loyalties. The popularization of science spread doubts about the validity of
Catholic doctrine, while historical research weakened the church's supernatural aura. The industrial revolution raised social problems that required new
policies lest the lower classes be alienated from the church. The unification
of Italy threatened the papacy's temporal rule and even its independence.
These multiple problems produced within the church two points of view
eventually identified as "liberal Catholicism" and "ultramontanism." Liberal
Catholicism was a European movement of intellectuals and political leaders
who urged the church to come to terms with the new age, maintaining that

there was no basic contradiction between modernism and the traditional
faith. But the papacy and hierarchy responded negatively. Over centuries the
church had been in a state of almost constant siege. Like most predecessors,
Pius IX (1846-1878) met the crisis by rejecting the new and reaffirming the
old. In the Syllabus of Errors (1864) the papacy listed, for the guidance of the
faithful, eighty propositions that were contrary to Catholic dogma. The final
defeat of liberal Catholicism came when the first Vatican Council on July 18,
1870, defined the doctrine of infallibility. Almost simultaneously with the
loss of its temporal sovereignty, the papacy advanced its greatest claim to
spiritual power: the claim that the pope, when speaking ex cathedra on matters
of faith and morals, was incapable of error.
The tension within the Catholic church was particularly apparent in Germany. Here, more than in any other European country, Catholicism had to
compete in the marketplace of ideas and loyalties. In German idealism Catholicism encountered a secular religion of Protestant origin that had won
general acceptance by the educated class. At the universities of Tubingen and
Munich Catholic historians and theologians strove to demonstrate the compatibility of their faith with German idealism and, after the latter's decay,
with the new scholarship.3 Its greatest figure was the priest-historian Ignaz
von Dollinger, whose three-volume history of the church treated Christianity
as a historical rather than a supernatural phenomenon. Politically Dollinger
was a conservative, but he saw that constitutionalism could be valuable to the
church by guaranteeing its freedom from the state. He recognized that the
church, in claiming its own freedom, must yield it to others as a universal
right.4
Germany was a major center of opposition to the decision of the Vatican
Council to clarify the dogma of infallibility. Meeting at Fulda in September
1869, the German bishops declared the time "inopportune" for action on the
dogma. Important laymen (Peter Reichensperger, Hermann von Mallinckrodt, and Ludwig Windthorst) likewise questioned the wisdom of the step.
Thirteen of seventeen German bishops attending the church council opposed
the declaration. Knowing' that it would pass, twelve left Rome rather than
participate in the final voting. Yet all of the German bishops soon submitted
to the authority of the church, as did the great majority of the German priesthood and lay Catholics from all classes in the population. Not every German
Catholic chose silence rather than schism. At the universities of Munich,
Bonn, and Breslau a number of Catholic professors refused to submit. Foremost in the resistance was Dollinger, who had sharply opposed the Vatican
declaration in a number of writings during 1869. When Dollinger was excom> See particularly Donald J. Dietrich, The Goethezeit and the Metamorphosis 0/Catholic Theology

municated in 1871, his colleagues elected him rector of the university. The
Bavarian king and government publicly sympathized with his cause. Dollinger's fate galvanized a movement of liberal Catholics who, regarding them­
selves as the guardians of the true faith, became known as "Old Catholics."5
Most European governments, whether Catholic or Protestant, feared that
the decisions of the Vatican Council would upset existing church-state rela­
tionships. This was true in Prussia despite the fact that here the Catholic
church had attained after sharp struggles a degree of freedom unknown else­
where in Germany.6 Earlier in the century (1837-1841) church and state had
become embroiled in controversy (the so-called "Cologne strife") over the
issues of mixed marriages and heresy on the theological faculty at the Univer­
sity of Bonn. After ascending the throne in 1840, Friedrich Wilhelm IV
ended the dispute by yielding on both points. Furthermore, he dismantled
many of the controls over the church established in the age of absolutism,
ending the state's monitoring of communications between curia and bishops
and largely abandoning the requirement of an official placet for ecclesiastical
laws. In addition, he granted to the bishops the right to approve (through the
grant of the missio canonica) those teaching Catholic doctrine in public
schools and universities and created within the Ministry of Education and
Religious Affairs (Kultusministenum) a separate department for Catholic af­
fairs that became the spokesman for Catholic interests within the govern­
ment. 7 The Prussian constitution of 1848-1850 appeared to consolidate still
further the relative independence of the Catholic church. Under it the rela­
tionship between church and state approached that stage of co-ordination
(Gleichordnung)—each autonomous within its own sphere—that had long
been the goal of the Catholic hierarchy.8 The attempt of Kultusminister von
Raumer in 1852 to inhibit Catholic missionary activity and restrict the right
of clergymen to study in Rome produced a vigorous reaction among Catholics.
Again the government capitulated. For nearly two decades thereafter the suc­
cessive governments of Manteuffel, the new era, and Bismarck adhered to the
constitution.
There remained one vital area where the authority and functions of church
and state overlapped, an area that was critically affected by the dispute within
the Catholic church over the doctrine of infallibility. Catholic theologians at

* The Kulturkampf *

the universities and teachers of Catholic doctrine in the upper schools were
simultaneously state officials and, with diminishing exceptions, priests.
Whether priests or laymen, they were as teachers subject to the discipline of
the bishop owing to his right to grant and withdraw the missio canonica. Initially the policy of the Bismarck government was to take no official notice of
the Vatican decree on infallibility and to avoid involvement in clashes between bishops and recalcitrant teachers and professors.9 The policy of nonintervention worked in three cases (Bonn, Cologne, and Breslau), but failed
in a fourth (Braunsberg in Ermeland), where the bishop was more aggressive
in pursuing the issue. The refusal of a certain Chaplain Wollmann to read to
his students a pastoral letter elucidating the dogma led to the withdrawal of
his missio canonica and to the excommunication of both Wollmann and the
director of the Gymnasium who supported him. The government not only
refused to dismiss the heretical teacher and administrator, but also insisted
that students either attend Wollmann's classes or be expelled.IO The Braunsberg case established a precedent for the entire monarchy. To the government
the bishop's action was an invasion of state authority; to Catholics the government's action was an invasion of church authority." Although the problem was thorny, the dispute over religious instruction in the schools and universities could not in itself have produced the Kulturkampf. That the issue
became magnified into a full-scale struggle between church and state was owing to other factors of greater significance.

Founding of the Center Party
Despite a Hohenzollern tradition of religious toleration dating back to the
Great Elector, Catholics had never felt secure in the Prussian state. The "Cologne strife" of 1837-1841 and the Raumer directives of 1852 were forceful
reminders that an authoritarian bureaucracy, accustomed to dominate the
Evangelical church, could not be depended upon to respect Catholic autonomy. Both affairs, even though they ended favorably for Catholics, left behind a sense of wary distrust. During the 1850s the conservative press continued to trumpet the virtues of the "Prussian evangelical state" or "Protestant
military state." If "co-ordinate" under the constitution, there was no real
"parity" between Catholic and Protestant in Prussia. Civil service, officer
corps, and university faculties remained overwhelmingly Protestant. Financial support appeared more plentiful for the Protestant than the Catholic

church and for Protestant rather than Catholic elementary schools.12 Begin­
ning with the election of 1852, Catholic deputies formed a separate caucus in
the Prussian Chamber of Deputies to defend Catholic interests. During the
1850s the party (numbering sixty-four deputies) made common cause with
the liberal opposition on such matters as civil liberties. The great issues of
the early 1860s, however, were those of military reform and the integrity of
the constitution. Upon these issues Catholic deputies could not take a firm
stand, probably because of their diverse social and political interests. As the
electorate polarized over the constitutional conflict, the Catholic caucus
(called the "Center party" after 1859) collapsed and dissolved.'3
The events of 1866 were thoroughly demoralizing for Catholic politicians.
For many Germans, Catholic as well as Protestant, the conflict between greatGermanism and small-Germanism, between Austrian and Prussian leadership
in Germany was simultaneously a conflict between Catholicism and Protes­
tantism. Those Catholics who saw the conflict in this light had to regard
themselves as among the defeated of Koniggratz. Their political leaders re­
acted in varying ways. August Reichensperger stopped reading newspapers,
dropped out of politics, for a time, and immersed himself in art history (he
was an authority on Gothic art). 1 4 His brother, Peter, reluctantly accepted
the North German Confederation as a necessity, being convinced that only
Prussia could construct a new "roof over Germany. On the other hand, MaIlinckrodt, who had lost his seat in the Chamber of Deputies in 1863, was
elected to the constituent Reichstag, where he risked his career as a Prussian
official by charging that Prussia, not Austria, had been responsible for the
recent war.I5 The most influential Catholic cleric, Baron Wilhelm Emmanuel
von Ketteler, bishop of Mainz, advised Catholics in a widely read book to
accept what they could not change and to cooperate in the completion of a
Ueindeutsch. unification.l6 The failure of the constituent Reichstag to incor­
porate in the north German constitution clauses on religious liberty from the
Prussian constitution caused many Catholic deputies (including Mallinckrodt, Windthorst, and Peter Reichensperger) to join progressives in voting

against the constitution as a whole. So disparate were their views that Catholic deputies were unable to find common ground upon which to form a caucus in either the Reichstag or Chamber of Deputies after 1867. Many entered
the Free Conservative party; some joined conservative Protestants in a shortlived caucus, the Federal-Constitutional union; others remained uncommitted.17
During the years that followed Catholics continued to feel isolated and on
the defensive. Bismarck's collaboration with liberals, the seeming dominance
of the liberal-national Zeitgeist in the Reichstag, the public's adverse reaction
to the summoning of the Vatican Council (June 29, 1868) and to the ensuing
public discussion of the dogma of infallibility—all tended to heighten their
sense of vulnerability. In August 1869 there were other warning signals. A
small, newly constructed Dominican chapel in Moabit, a working-class district of Berlin, was sacked by a mob soon after its dedication on August 4.
The Berliner Arbeiterverein and various liberal organizations petitioned the
Chamber of Deputies either to abolish all cloisters or to enforce strictly a
statute of 1810 restricting their expansion. The committee on petitions, Rudolf Gneist reporting, recommended the latter course.18 But the Prussian cabinet, on Bismarck's advice, refused to support disabilities against Catholics
(February 1870), and the committee report was tabled, despite attempts by
Mallinckrodt, supported by about eighty Catholic deputies, to force debate
on the issue.I9
During June 1870 the first steps were taken to draft a Catholic political
program in view of the coming elections for the Reichstag and Chamber of
Deputies. The outbreak of war in July and the coming completion of German
unification added urgency to the task. Assemblies of leading Catholics at
Munster (June 14, 1870) and Soest (October 28, 1870) produced programs
stressing religious demands (autonomy of the church, freedom of faith,
church marriage, confessional schools, and "actual'.' parity of "recognized religions"), political demands (preservation of federalism, rejection of the unitary state, reduction of military expenditures), and social demands (harmonization of the interests of capitalists and landowners, strengthening of the
middle class, and legislative action to improve the condition of factory workers).20 The parliamentary caucuses of the Center party, organized after the
November and March elections of 1870-1871, reached fifty-eight deputies in
the Prussian Chamber of Deputies and sixty-one in the Reichstag.21

tifying the new caucus as Catholic, even though the title had already been
used by Catholic deputies in the Prussian Chamber of Deputies during the
early 1860s. But the new party quickly became identified in the press and
public mind as a Catholic party and its deputies were often designated as
"clericals." In parliament a few Protestant deputies were accepted as Hospitanten (for example, Ludwig von Gerlach and the Hanoverian Guelph Ludwig
Briiel), but the party as a whole never attracted a significant number of Protestant voters.22 Catholic members of the Free Conservative party refused with
few exceptions (most notably Karl Friedrich von Savigny), to join, as did
many liberals (notably Max von Forckenbeck). Many of the newly elected
Catholic representatives from southern Germany joined the Liberal Reich
party and, after its dissolution, the Free Conservative and National Liberal
parties. Polish deputies, furthermore, insisted on maintaining their own caucus, as did the deputies from the Reichsland. Nor did the Center succeed in
capturing the whole of the Catholic vote. Although 36.2 percent of the electorate was Catholic, the Center received only 17 percent of the ballots cast
or less than half of the Catholic vote.23
The first parliamentary demarche of the Center was poorly chosen for a
party desiring to widen its confessional base. On February 18, 1871, the Center caucus in the Prussian Chamber of Deputies sent an address to Kaiser WiIhelm at Versailles requesting his intervention for the restoration of the temporal rule of the papacy. Wilhelm did not reply, but the speech from the
throne opening the Reichstag on March 21 contained a passage that bore on
the problem: "The respect that Germany demands for its own independence
it willingly pays to other states and peoples, the weak as well as the strong."
In a responding address the Reichstag declared, "The day of intervention in
the internal life of other peoples will, we hope, never recur under any pretext,
in any form." Leaders of the Center attacked this passage as unacceptable and
voted against the entire address. But the centrists remained almost alone in
their protest (six Polish deputies abstained from voting) and the address
passed, March 30, by an overwhelming majority (243 to 63).24
Unquestionably the Center made a bad tactical error in raising this issue.
The address, which had been approved in advance by all other parties of the
Reichstag, was intended as a patriotic demonstration of national unity and
retroactive approval of all that Bismarck, the Kaiser, and the armies had accomplished in the recent war.25 Certainly the passage to which the centrists
objected was an unnecessary slap by the liberals at "ultramontanes." By refusing to accept it, however, the Center exposed itself to the charge of seeking
military intervention by the new Reich in behalf of the papacy in the tradition of the early medieval empire. At the moment of final achievement of

* The Kulturkampf *

German unification the Center went on record as opposing the cause of national self-determination in Italy. It was a quixotic effort. Like the progressives during 1862-1866 and national liberals during 1867-1870, the centrists
had no real possibility of influencing Bismarck's foreign policy. They tilted at
windmills.
This disastrous debut prejudiced the success of the Center's attempt on
April 1-4, 1871, to incorporate into the Reich constitution six articles from
the Prussian constitution guaranteeing (with some elasticity) freedom of
speech, press, assembly religious belief, and the autonomy of ecclesiastical
institutions. If they thought to enjoy the support of liberals on this issue, the
centrists were soon disabused. Their opponents pointed out that the amendment was centralistic in import and hardly consonant with the federal emphasis in the program of the Center party.26 But the Center's list of civil liberties was also somewhat limited. It did not include, Treitschke noted,
freedom for science and learning or the right to civil marriage. If centrists
were inconsistent, liberals were more so. In venting their spleen against "clericals," liberals of all stripes (except the extreme left) repudiated their traditional support of civil liberties under the constitution. In 1848, declared Miquel, an inexperienced liberal party had erroneously believed that every
reduction in state power was a gain for freedom. As a result, article 15 of the
Prussian constitution had granted to the Catholic church "an unheard-of special position." Again the Center found itself isolated in the chamber. Its bill
was rejected 223 to 59.27
For liberals the debates of March 30-April 4, 1871, were the beginning of
the Kulturkampf. They occurred in an atmosphere of crisis over the doctrine
of infallibility. In Bavaria Dollinger and the archbishop of Munich had
reached the fork in the road (March 28 and April 2), and on April 3 the
faculty of the university came out for Dollinger, as did a public mass meeting
on April 10.28 Simultaneously the Braunsberg school controversy reached its
climax. "The conflict between church and state," Stauffenberg told the
Reichstag, "has now passed from theory into reality." Robert Romer, a Wiirttemberg national liberal, charged that for centrists the highest authority was
not the German Kaiser but the pope. "The issue today is: Rome or Germany."29
Bismarck's Decision to Attack
The perception of the Catholic church and its political ambitions that ultimately led Bismarck into the Kulturkampf was formed during the 1850s. On
hearing of the founding of the Catholic caucus in 1852, he wrote to Otto

Manteuffel, "The lust for conquest in the Catholic camp will not allow us to
avoid indefinitely an open struggle with it." As long as the right-wing parties
in the chamber held together, the "ultramontane party" would be compelled
to make common cause with liberals. This coupling of "Jesuitry with liberal­
ism," if properly exploited by the government press, could cost the liberals
such sympathy as they still enjoyed in the eastern provinces. He advised Man­
teuffel against withdrawal of the Raumer directives on the grounds that "no
secure alliance can be formed with the ultramontane party," for which every
concession was but an installment, and a further incitement, toward the ul­
timate goal of complete domination. 30
During 1853-1854 Bismarck followed a controversy between the govern­
ment of Baden and the bishop of Freiburg and concluded that the conflict had
more than local significance. It was indicative of the "militant, insatiable,
and irreconcilable spirit" that for a decade had driven "part of the Catholic
clergy" to seek domination over all Protestant sovereigns. Concessions would
only lead to new demands, until the clergy attained their ultimate goal of
"unlimited rule." 31 Ludwig von Gerlach's defense of the bishop in the Kreuz'
zeitung so incensed Bismarck that he feared the violence of his own un-Christian emotions. It was then that he wrote to Leopold von Gerlach the letter,
previously quoted,32 describing the struggle against Catholicism as one of his
most difficult tasks in Frankfurt, equating "Catholicism" with "enemy of Prus­
sia" in southern Germany, and denying that Catholicism ("a hypocritical,
idolatrous papism full of hate and cunning" whose "presumptuous dogma fal­
sified God's revelation and nurtured idolatry as a basis for worldly domina­
tion") was a Christian faith.33 In June 1855 he discussed with a Prussian police
officer the evidence of Catholic subversion in southern Germany, particularly
in connection with the festival at Fulda on the eleven hundredth anniversary
of the death of St. Boniface, and came to the conclusion that "these conspir­
34
ators are more dangerous for us now than democrats."
Bismarck's aversion to political Catholicism was so strong that he failed to
assess correctly the position of the Catholic caucus (now called the Center
party) at the beginning of the constitutional conflict. While annoyed by Prus­
sian recognition of the kingdom of Italy, the Center was divided over the
army bill and, because of this ambivalence, strove to steer a moderate course
between the government and parliamentary opposition. In a dispatch to
Rome (October 24, 1862) Bismarck asserted that the Center, a party held
together less by political than by religious conviction, was even more hostile
to the government than were extreme democrats. For many reasons, but par3° GW, I, 257-258, 264.

ticularly because of its religious character, he would regret having to fight the
party with "kindred weapons." Rome too ought to avoid such a struggle, in
view of the privileges enjoyed by the church under the constitution of 1848—
1850. The state had a right to expect that Prussian Catholics would be guided
by their "obligations to king and country" rather than by "political partisanship." It was obvious, he concluded, that this advice also applied to the Polish
clergy. If the archbishop of Posen-Gnesen should "mix religion and politics,"
the government expected Rome to give him no encouragement or protection.^
During the years 1866-18 70 Bismarck's suspicions of Catholic hostility and
aggression rose again to the surface. In the fall of 1866 the Landtag's Catholic
caucus, in the final months of its existence, voted against a number of critical
measures presented by the government: the indemnity bill, the annexations,
a large government loan, and the dotation bill rewarding Bismarck and the
generals for the recent victory. While unable to block any of these statutes,
the oppositional stance of the Catholic deputies, coupled with that of the
progressives, disturbed the picture of internal solidarity that Bismarck wished
to project before southern Germany and Europe. The Catholic caucus, he
complained to Rome in December 1866, was "the most hostile in the chamber," its attacks on the government "exceeding in animosity those of the democrats themselves."36 Nor were Bismarck's fears dimmed by the dissolution of
the first Center party and obvious signs of confusion in the Catholic camp.
The struggle over civil liberties in the constituent Reichstag, the association
between Catholic and Guelph particularists, the danger of a Catholic league
of European powers, the role of the ultramontanes in strengthening southern
resistance to the completion of unification, and particularly the part played
by the Catholic clergy in nurturing the spirit of Polish nationalism37—all of
these developments, real and imagined, reinforced Bismarck's belief in the
existence of a widespread Catholic conspiracy that posed a threat to both his
German and European policies.38
In 1868-1870 Bismarck repeatedly appealed (as he had in 1862 and 1866)
to the pope to exercise his influence to halt this "continuing secret and open

During most of his years in office Bismarck wasfirmlyconvinced that the conspiracy reached
as far as the palace and even to the Kaiser's bedchamber, where Kaiserin Augusta, secretly
prompted by ultramontane clerics and by the French ambassador, Viscount Gontaut-Biron,
sought to prejudice the Kaiser against his chancellor's politics. For just a few of the many sources

war of circles in the Catholic church against Prussia." Clergy had combined
with "democrats and radicals" in an "unnatural alliance" willing to indulge in
"every slander, defamation, and lie" to defeat the national party in the recent
Zollverein elections. Southern Catholic newspapers, supplemented by the
Catholic press in France and Belgium, had competed with one another in
printing this "filth." Yet the Catholic church enjoyed in Prussia and northern
Germany a freedom unrivaled anywhere in the rest of Germany and Europe.
While personally well disposed toward the Catholic church, Bismarck
warned, he could not continue to defend its interests in the face of such hostility. Those who contended that the Catholic church was a danger to Prussia
and the confederation and that lasting peace with the Catholic church was
impossible would gain in influence. By exerting its powers to moderate and
halt this agitation, on the other hand, Rome could prove its willingness to
ally with Berlin against revolution, rather than the reverse.39
In these documents one can see the familiar characteristics of Bismarck's
political technique-—the litany of benefits accorded and injuries received, the
revelation of his own pivotal position and of the options at his disposal. But
they also show (like their predecessors in 1862 and 1866) Bismarck's continuing conviction that the key to his political difficulties with German Catholics lay in Rome. Despite the efforts of Harry von Arnim, the north German
representative at the Vatican, to disabuse him on this point, the chancellor
remained unshaken in his belief that Rome did possess the power to control
not only the political conduct of the ecclesiastical hierarchy and the priesthood in general, but also that of Catholic laymen and the Catholic press
everywhere in Europe. During the late 1860s he sought continually to get the
Vatican to see that its true interest was to use that power to get German
Catholics to accept Prussian leadership.40 His vision of the Catholic church
was that of a "tightly organized" monarchical institution capable of commanding "unquestioned obedience" from the faithful, both clerical and lay,
not only in matters of faith but also in matters of political conduct.41
Undoubtedly Bismarck did believe that Prussia was the target of an ultramontane crusade, so unremitting in its hostility that normally conservative
clergy, serving a conservative institution, were willing to make common
cause with political and social radicals and with national revolutionaries in
Prussian Poland. What he wrote to Rome on this score might have been exaggerated for political effect, but he repeated the charge within the councils
of the Prussian government and in private conversation.42 As long as German
unification remained incomplete, nevertheless, he was in a poor position to
carry out the threats in his dispatches to Arnim. Every overt struggle either

with the north German clergy or with the papacy itself had to be avoided lest
moderate Catholics, particularly in the south, be mobilized by the ultramon­
43
tanes against Prussia. In February 1870 Bismarck joined the Prussian cabinet
in rejecting the initiative of the Chamber of Deputies in the Moabit affair,
refused to back Governor-General von Horn in his conflict with the Arch­
bishop Ledochowski of Posen-Gnesen, and dispatched the Prussian Duke of
Ratibor as Wilhelm's personal representative at the jubilee of Pius IX. 44 But
the most striking examples of Bismarck's hands-off policy toward the church
before 18 71 are to be seen in his attitude toward the Vatican Council in 18691870 and toward the "Roman question" during 1870-1871.
As the Vatican Council approached and the preliminary debate within the
church on the subject of infallibility gained in heat, Bismarck took the view
that the affair was an internal concern of the church that need not involve
the north German government unless the council should "transgress on the
area of the state." He hoped, nevertheless, that friction within the church
would weaken the ultramontanes and hence mitigate the effectiveness of their
agitation against Berlin. Hence he willingly supported the unsuccessful efforts
of Catholic governments (first Bavaria, later France and Austria-Hungary) to
form a common front of European powers toward the Vatican Council. 45 Yet
he firmly rejected Arnim's pleas that Berlin initiate such an action on the
grounds that any intervention by a Protestant power would consolidate rather
than divide the council. The government had no cause to fear the results of
the council, he instructed Arnim, for it possessed the legislative power with
which to counteract any ensuing invasion of the rights of the state. In mas­
tering such a crisis the government could rely on the "developed state con­
sciousness of the nation"—among the majority of Catholics as well as the
predominant majority of Evangelicals.46 "To take up the struggle over Cath­
olic dogma on Roman terrain," he wrote to Abeken at the time of the Vatican
Council in June 1870, "would be like attacking the Leviathan in water; we
will let him come on dry land first, that is, onto the floor of practical execu­
tion of the dogma under Prussian state law; there we are superior to him." 4 7
He was willing to lend sympathy and support to the oppositional German
bishops, but only if they requested it, which they did not. Bismarck correctly
foresaw that the German bishops would eventually submit to the will of the

council, whatever their personal views on infallibility. Yet he did expect that
the controversy would "loosen" the "compact organization" of the church and
disrupt the unanimity of the Catholic press in its hostility toward Berlin.48
The Roman question became acute in 1870 when Napoleon III was compelled to withdraw the French garrison that had since i860 preserved the
pope's rule over the city. Desperately the curia surveyed the European scene
for support against Italian occupation of the holy city. For Bismarck, intervention in behalf of the pope (a policy urged upon Wilhelm by the Empress
Augusta in numerous letters)49 was unthinkable, since it would have driven
Italy into the arms of revolutionary France. Yet he did believe that political
benefits might be derived from limited assistance to the papal court. He
sought to persuade the government in Florence to treat the pontiff respectfully
and, after some hesitation, he renewed an offer (first extended in 1866) of
asylum of the pope in Germany, either at Fulda or Cologne.50 It ought to be
useful, he remarked to Busch, to demonstrate to German and Polish Catholics
that Berlin was the "sole power now existing that is capable of protecting the
head of their church."5' Although Pius remained in the Vatican, Bismarck
continued to seek in Rome leverage to be used against German Catholics.
When it appeared that the "clerical party" in Bavaria might succeed in defeating the treaty for union with the north, he wired Arnim (December 21,
1870) to point out to the curia that such an action would not halt German
unification, but would merely force him "to seek and find the basis for Kaiser
and Reich in the public opinion" that demanded their creation, identifying
Catholicism with those elements that had successfully opposed the new Germany. Would this accord with the wishes and interests of the curia? "Such a
situation would be contrary to our desires, but we shall have to face the
facts."52 Again the results were disappointing. On January 18, 1871, he telegraphed Arnim that clerical influences were still active in Bavaria against the
treaty despite the "unquestionable sympathy exhibited by the pope for us."53
Throughout the winter and spring Bismarck persisted in a policy of neutrality on the Roman question, seeking to avoid alienating either the papacy
or the Italian government, while exploiting their mutual hostility to extract
favors from both.54 To all entreaties, including personal letters from the pope
to Wilhelm and the sending of a papal emissary (Archbishop Ledochowski)
to Versailles, he replied that Germany would only participate in a common

step initiated by the European powers, an event of which there was little
likelihood. In February he agreed to Arnim's suggestion that, in view of the
failure to gain assistance against ultramontanism, the connection with Rome
ought to be loosened. Arnim was withdrawn at the beginning of March and
the Reich's representation at the Vatican left to the Bavarian envoy, Count
Tauffkirchen. Yet Bismarck continued (on March 31, May 1, and May 19,
1871) to urge the Italian government to avoid unnecessary affronts to the
pope.55 He still believed, in other words, that good relations with the papacy
might have some usefulness in German politics.
Bismarck claimed later that his initial reaction to the founding of the Center party was not hostile.56 One of the founders, after all, was Karl Friedrich
von Savigny, the high-level Prussian diplomat who had helped steer the constitution of the North German Confederation through the council of ministers and constituent Reichstag. His presence held out the prospect that the
party's conservatism would outweigh its Catholicism and that the party would
support "common national interests." According to the chancellor, the party's position on the address to the Kaiser and on a bill of rights in the imperial
constitution destroyed these expectations. The clerical caucus, he wrote to
the Prussian envoy in Munich, had become a purely confessional party, whose
voters were willing to sacrifice national for Catholic interests. The aggressiveness of the clericals compelled the government itself to take the offensive, as
a matter of self-defense.57 But Bismarck ordered the envoy, nevertheless, not
to become identified with the Dollinger movement. While its relations with
the Catholic church had become more difficult, the Reich must maintain
neutrality in disputes over dogma.58
There was another reason for caution. Bismarck had launched yet another
attempt to get the papacy to change the course of the Center party. On April
17, 1871, he instructed Tauffkirchen to find an opportunity to inform the
curia that the aggressive conduct of the Center had increased antipapal sentiment in Germany. Four days later he was gratified to receive a telegram from
Tauffkirchen stating that the papal secretary of state, Cardinal Antonelli, had
"disapproved and deplored the conduct of the Catholic, so-called Center caucus in the Reichstag as tactless and untimely." On May 10, he could report
that the pope himself had characterized the Center's actions as "inopportune

and impractical" in an interview with the Austrian envoy, Count Gustav von
Kalnoky.59 One can imagine with what elation Bismarck must have received
these messages. They seemed to confirm the wisdom of the policy he had
followed for so many months. Surely the Center party must respond to the
pope's displeasure. If not, it was now at least completely isolated, cut off from
Rome as well as from other political parties, and hence exposed and vulnerable.
On May 14, 1871, Bismarck empowered Count Frankenberg, a free conservative leader, to make known what he had learned from Rome in a speech
to Silesian constituents, which was widely reported in the German press.
When the accuracy of the report was challenged by Catholic journalists Bismarck wrote a letter confirming it to Frankenberg that was published in the
Nationaheitung on June 23. 60 No sooner had it appeared than it was disavowed. Bishop Ketteler released to the press a letter of June 5 from Cardinal
Antonelli that contained a far different account of his remarks to Tauffkirchen. According to the state secretary, he had merely criticized as "premature" what he had understood to be an attempt of the Center to get the
parliament to declare itself in favor of intervention on behalf of the papacy.
The Center, Ketteler pointed out, had made no such attempt; hence even
Antonelli's mild criticism was beside the point. Antonelli's letter went on to
urge Catholic deputies, as a matter of conscience, to "seize every opportunity"
to preserve and defend their religion and the rights of the papacy against all
attempts at intimidation.61 When Tauffkirchen gained another interview
with Antonelli on June 26, the cardinal clung to the position outlined in the
letter to Ketteler and explained away the earlier impression he had given the
envoy as a misunderstanding.62
Sometime during June, days before he learned of Antonelli's retraction,
Bismarck decided to take the offensive against clerical and ultramontane influences in Prussian and German public life. In his diary Prince Hohenlohe
wrote that on the evening of June 19 Bismarck read to him the letter to Frankenberg, asking him whether he approved. "I said that I could raise no objection, though the clericals would not be altogether pleased." Bismarck replied
that he did not care to please them. He found the clericals' alliance with such
democrats as Schroder-Lippstadt exceedingly irritating; it might have
"knocked the bottom out of the cask." He proposed to proceed "more vigorously against them and in particular to expel the Kratzig clique" from the
government.63

Adalbert Kratzig was head of the Catholic department of Prussia's Kultusministerium. The Catholic and Protestant departments were twin agencies
through which the Prussian government exercised its powers over religious
affairs. Bismarck believed that under Kratzig the Catholic department had
become a Trojan horse within the walls. Instead of representing the interests
of the government toward the Catholic church and Polish population, the
department had become their advocate and protector within the government.64 On June 26 the Prussian cabinet accepted Bismarck's decision, with
the reluctant acquiescence of Kultnsminister Heinrich von Miihler, to unite
the two departments under a Protestant head and transfer Kratzig to a harmless post in the judiciary. At the same meeting the cabinet reluctantly rejected
as too far reaching a proposal to resolve the Braunsberg school controversy by
ending compulsory religious instruction in all Gymnasien; instead it upheld
school regulations compelling Catholic students to attend the dissident WoIlmann's classes.65
Four days earlier the German public had already been informed of the general significance of what was to come. On June 22, 1871, the Kreuzzeitung
published a sensational article, generally believed to have been written by
Hermann Wagener and to have a semiofficial character. By choosing the title
"Center Party," the article charged, the clericals had attempted to disguise its
sectarian character. Its members and allies had used every means at their disposal to hinder German unification. By raising the religious issue they had
now reopened anotherfissuredividing the German people. In the face of such
aggression the German Reich could not remain on the defensive. In the near
future it must decide to confront aggression with aggression, "abroad as well
as at home." Three hundred years ago Germanism had proven stronger than
Romanism. How much stronger must it be now that Rome was no longer
capital of the world and the German imperial crown was worn by a German
rather than a Spanish prince.66
Bismarck neither planned nor foresaw the extent of the long struggle between church and state that began in the summer of 1871. He appears to have
believed that a show of force would impress the Vatican with his seriousness,
compelling the pope to use his allegedly absolutistic powers to halt the ultramontane crusade against the German Reich. "I do not want war with the
church, not even with the Catholic church," Miihler recorded him as saying
in June 1871, "but in order to have a just peace, those on the other side must
first recognize that we will permit ourselves to be oppressed and trod upon

only to a certain degree and that we have the power and the will, when necessary, to defend ourselves." In October he spoke to Miihler of the ultramontanes as merely "outposts." "The actual army stands on the other side of the
Alps."6?

Motivation
Historians have long disputed over what motives led Bismarck into the morass
of the Kulturkampf, particularly over whether they are to be found in foreign
or domestic politics—whether the Kulturkampf, in other words, was a product of the Primat der Ausseri' or lnnenpolitik. The issue, however, is misconceived, for Bismarck did not in this case separate foreign from domestic politics. His motivation in the Kulturkampf was composed of a complex of
mutually supporting ideas, prejudices, and circumstances, no one of which
would have been adequate to produce the end result. At the base of the complex was his earlier conviction that Prussia was the object of a malevolent
crusade on the part of ultramontane clergy and laymen. Their ultimate goal
was domination over all governments, particularly over the Hohenzollern
monarchy as the chief Protestant power in Europe. Evidence of this crusade
could be seen in the unanimity with which the Catholic press throughout
Europe attacked Prussia, the efforts to forge a hostile alliance among Catholic
powers in Europe, Catholic support for German particularism and Guelph
resistance, the nourishment of Polish nationalism by Catholic clergy, the formation of the Center party on a purely confessional basis, the willingness of
conservative Catholics to make common cause with democratic radicals and
even socialists, and the church's demand for blind obedience under an infallible pope.
All of these concerns were connected with the general problem of consolidation, the solution to which was Bismarck's principal goal after 1867. Seen
in this light, his attack on political Catholicism in the Kulturkampf was intimately related to all of his other foreign and domestic policies during this
period: the reconstruction of the eastern alliance; collaboration with liberal
and national parties; the Germanization of ethnic minorities; the development of Reich institutions; expansion of industrial capitalism; and passage of
integrating legislation. While interwoven with these many other policies of
the period, the Kulturkampf differed in character. They were constructive
policies, aimed at building economic, institutional, and psychological unity,
but the Kulturkampf was primarily destructive, aimed at the elimination of
the Center party (or at least of its confessional base), the liquidation of clerical influence within the Prussian government and public schools, the wid6

ening of the schism within the Catholic church produced by the infallibility
controversy, the weakening of the relationship between the universal church
and its German branch, and the rupture of an old alliance between clericalism
and Polish nationalism and of an incipient alliance between clericalism and
social radicalism. Having excised Austrian and French influence in German
affairs through the military arm of the state, Bismarck now strove to excise
ultramontane influences through its legislative and executive arms. As in
1866 and 1870, he waited to strike until the foe appeared isolated and vulnerable.
Bismarck was not alone in exaggerating the Catholic menace. Throughout
Europe statesmen, liberals, and Protestants shared the fears generated by the
attempt of the curia to meet the challenges of the century by heightening
papal authority through the Syllabus of Errors and Vatican Council. Yet Bismarck was unique in that he viewed himself as a complete realist, an observer
of the actual world and the forces that moved it, unprejudiced by personal
motives or ideological passions. Where political Catholicism was concerned
the capacity for objective judgment that had led him earlier from triumph to
triumph in foreign and domestic affairs deserted him. Events were to prove,
furthermore, that he overvalued the capacity of the state (at least within the
means he possessed) to mold reality through its power to legislate and administer, and he undervalued the tenacity with which men cling to their ideals
and traditions in the face of political persecution. The Leviathan proved to
be nearly as formidable on dry land as in water.
Bismarck's judgment in the summer of 1871 was clouded by sheer hubris.
His unbroken series of triumphs, climaxed by the favorable treaty with France
signed at Frankfurt, left him in an exultant mood. On appearing in the
Reichstag to announce the treaty on May 12, he was greeted with tumultuous
applause by the deputies. On the same day Count Waldersee found him "decidedly proud" of his achievement.68 Four days later, lubricated by much beer
and May wine, he regaled Prince Hohenlohe with the tale of how he had
outfoxed Thiers and Favre in the negotiations. "He treats everyone with a
certain arrogance, . . ." Hohenlohe wrote in his diary, "He is the terror of all
diplomatists."69 Another contemporary and associate, Gustav von Diest,
found Bismarck's "whole nature" changed after the war of 1870-1871: "He
no longer tolerated contradiction; he was accessible to flattery; even the
smallest, alleged disregard for his ego and his position exasperated him."7° His
pointless quarrel with the Reichstag (related earlier)71 over the governance of
Alsace-Lorraine was symptomatic of his mood.

* A Time for "Liberalism," 1871-1875 *

In all of Bismarck's writings and recorded remarks it is necessary to distinguish where possible between what he believed and what he said for tactical
purposes. Certainly he was conscious of the propaganda value of associating
"black and red" in a common conspiracy against the government. We have
seen him advise Manteuffel in 1852 to couple "Jesuitry with liberalism" in the
government press in order to frighten liberal Protestant voters. During the
Reichstag election campaign in February 1870 he instructed his Leibjoumcdist
Busch to write, whenever opportunity offered, of the "Savigny-Bebel" or
"Liebknecht-Savigny" party.72 There can be little doubt, nevertheless, that
Bismarck actually believed that the Catholic opposition was willing to ally
with any subversive force, of whatever character, in order to "undermine the
authority of the government."73 We have seen that he regarded the clergy as
chiefly responsible for the growth of Polonism and the decline of Germanism
in the eastern provinces and that his policies toward the Poles were based on
this conviction. It is also apparent that he regarded the Center party as an
abnormal phenomenon in party politics owing to its inclusion of men of disparate views (conservatives and democrats) and social classes (aristocrats,
bourgeois, workers). He could not comprehend how August Reichensperger,
a conservative Prussian official, could associate for any normal political end
with Schroder-Lippstadt, a barricade fighter of 1848, and with Windthorst,
the Hanoverian Guelph. He concluded that the only bond was religious fanaticism, which ought to play no role in politics, "What do you intend with
this party?" he asked Reichensperger.74
Bismarck's sensitivity to a black and red alliance also arose from an awareness of the vulnerability of his regime on the "social question." Earlier we saw
that his discussions with Hermann Wagener and Ferdinand Lassalle during
the constitutional conflict led him to speculate on the advantages of state
socialism as a means of winning working-class votes.75 In 1866, however, he
turned in another direction, finding in German nationalism moral justification for Prussian expansion and in the bourgeoisie the social support for German consolidation. By 1871 he had begun to fear that the Catholic opposition might seize the opportunity he had passed up in 1866. Since 1848 the
"Christian-social" idea had made steady progress in the Catholic church.
Bishop Ketteler's greatest achievement was to ground social reform in Catholic theory and to make it a Christian moral imperative. In the period that
saw the triumph of Manchesterism in Prussian government and party politics,
the bishop borrowed from Lassalle the idea of productive associations. While
his understanding of the social problem was limited (the artisans were his
primary concern, and he rejected state aid), Ketteler's contention that Chris'* Busch, TagebucKblatter, II, 148, 160.

tian love and charity must cope with general social problems opened the way
for other clergymen to attack the social ills of the factory system.76 By the end
of the 1860s there had begun to develop in the Ruhr and Rhineland a Chris­
tian-social movement organized in Catholic workers associations and sup­
ported by its own press. By March 1870 the associations were able to hold at
Elberfeld theirfirstgeneral convention. Whereas Catholic clergymen had ear­
lier attacked socialists and communists as subversive of church, government,
and society, those involved in the Christian-social movement aimed at a new
target—atheistic liberalism and laissez-faire capitalism. Despite all that di­
vided them in matters of religion, socially concerned Catholics had found
common ground with socialists.77 Bismarck's sharp reaction to this develop­
ment shows his sensitivity to the fact that collaboration with liberals and
people of property had left his regime with a highly exposed left flank. The
counterattack he launched in June 1871 was directed at both Catholics and
socialists. During that crucial month he not only took the first steps toward
the Kulturkampf, but he discussed with Russia and Austria-Hungary joint ac­
tion against the Socialist International. ?8
For Bismarck the Kulturkampf was primarily an "internal preventive war"
against dangers, real and imagined, that threatened the consolidation of the
German Reich. Yet there was a secondary motivation of more positive char­
acter; namely, the desire to reconstruct the relationship between church and
state in Prussia. Bismarck's distaste for bureaucratic government led him in
the early 1870s to seek greater autonomy or "self-administration" in local,
provincial, and church government. In each case the first signs of this inten­
tion can be seen in his rejection of the plans of his fellow Prussian ministers
to integrate the provinces annexed in 1866 into the Prussian state. Earlier it
was shown how he defeated the projects of Eulenburg, Lippe, and Heydt.
Now Muhler suffered the same fate. By imposing a common church consti­
tution, the minister intended to integrate the Lutheran and Calvinist
churches in the new provinces into the Prussian Evangelical church under the
supreme headship (Summepisfapat) of the king. In the course of time he ex­
pected the Lutheran and Calvinist congregations would voluntarily accept
the "Evangelical union" that had been imposed on the old provinces by King
Friedrich Wilhelm III. King Wilhelm, on the other hand, looked upon the
union as a "sacred inheritance" from his father and brother whose extension
into the new provinces could not wait. Bismarck succeeded in delaying and

defeating both plans on the grounds that the resentments created by coercion
would increase resistance to Prussian rule. 79
Bismarck's opposition was more than a matter of political expediency. He
held convictions about the proper relationship between church and state in
stark contrast to those of Wilhelm I, Muhler, and most conservatives. It was
not the task of the state, he believed, to intervene in affairs of the church by
legislating on matters of belief or ecclesiastical structure. In harmony with his
pietistic faith he judged that the state could not elevate religious life, al­
though it could further the work of the church through financial support. The
implications of this philosophy were nothing less than radical: the sovereignty
exercised by the monarch over the Protestant church for four hundred years
should be abolished; the state must no longer impose the Evangelical union;
the church must govern its own affairs on the provincial level; clergymen
should no longer act as supervisors in the public schools; religion should no
longer be a subject of instruction in the educational system.80
While he favored separation of church and state, Bismarck's conception of
that term was not as far-reaching as that obtaining in the United States or
even in Great Britain. It was not his intention to disestablish the Protestant
church, which would continue to receive support from the treasury; nor did
he propose that the last remaining manorial right of the estate owners, that
of naming the local pastor, should be abolished; needless to say, he did not
intend to sever the ideological bond between throne and altar that had made
the Protestant church for four centuries the chief moral bastion of the aristo­
cratic-monarchical order. Bismarck appears to have arrived at his basic posi­
tion on church and state sometime after 1866. Just when is difficult to say, for
he was absorbed in other tasks in these years, and naturally he was chary about
making all of his views known to either the Kaiser or the Kultusminister. The
first basic discussion with Muhler occurred in early 1869, and the result was
mutual frustration. As a consequence, Bismarck's first stroke for the separa­
tion of church and state (the fusion on July 8, 1871, of the Catholic and
Protestant departments of the Kultusministenum under a Protestant director)
was aimed at the Catholic rather than the Protestant church. "Since you
hindered me in executing [my plans] in the Evangelical church," he subse­
8
quently told Muhler, "I must enter by way of Rome." '

* The Kulturkampf *

201

In August 1871 at Bad Ems, where these words were spoken, Bismarck
finally revealed to the minister his full intentions: "struggle against the ultra­
montane party, especially in the Polish regions . . . ; separation of church
and state, of church and school altogether; transfer of school inspection to
laymen, abolition of religious instruction from the schools, primary as well as
secondary; transfer of religious affairs to the minister of justice." The pious
Muhler was shocked by this Godless proposition, and his eavesdropping wife
went down on her knees to pray that her husband would not agree to it. Had
Bismarck, Muhler asked, revealed to Wilhelm the extent of his plans? "No,"
was the wrathful answer, "I know where the Kaiser stands. If you do not make
him shy for me, I will lead him, despite it all, whither I will."82 Muhler had
only two choices: either resign or execute Bismarck's will. Instead he chose
the middle road, the most dangerous of all, hoping to protect the Evangelical
church from Bismarck's plans, while yielding to his demands for more ener­
getic measures against ultramontanes. Bismarck forced him into one compro­
mise after another, harassing him all the while with accusations of inactivity:
"In this struggle we need a commander. . . . For a minister you are too cor­
rect. . . . Are you secretly a Catholic?" Miihler's compromises alienated his
conservative friends, while Bismarck's complaints isolated the hapless minis­
ter in the cabinet and undermined Wilhelm's trust. Behind the scenes the
chancellor mobilized liberals and free conservatives for a vote of no confi­
dence in the Landtag. In mid-January 1872 Muhler resigned.83 Bismarck had
rid himself of another of those "useless old men."
In his successor, Adalbert FaIk, Bismarck found a more suitable instrument
for the pursuit of his objectives. Born in Silesia, the son and grandson of
Protestant pastors, FaIk had been trained in law, had served as a state's attor­
ney, and had been since 1868 a privy counselor in the Prussian Ministry of
Justice; he had had political experience as a deputy in the Landtag, member
of the constituent Reichstag, and Prussian delegate to the Bundesrat. His po­
litical orientation was national liberal, and his appointment strengthened the
reputedly liberal wing (Camphausen, Delbriick, Leonhardt) of the "cabinet
of two souls," as it was known in the liberal press.84 Falk's appointment came
as a surprise, for he was not widely known. His appointment reflected Bis­
marck's desire ultimately to place church affairs under the control of the Min­
istry of Justice, from which he expected a more "nonpartisan" treatment. 85
FaIk shared with Bismarck the conviction that the sphere of the state had to
be made secure against incursions by the church. No more than Bismarck did

he conceive the Kulturkampf as a conflict of religious or world views. Unlike
the chancellor, however, he conducted it as a legal rather than a political
struggle. He did not doubt that the legislative and police power of the state
would suffice to achieve the end in view. The function of the state was to
legislate, the duty of the citizen to obey. But he seems also to have been
sincerely convinced that none of the laws he fostered actually invaded the
proper sphere of the church and that obedience to them could not justly be
regarded by Catholics as contrary to conscience. He judged the Catholic conscience from the standpoint of a Protestant.86

The Kulturkampf Laws
"What is expected of me?" FaIk asked Bismarck when they discussed his new
assignment. Bismarck's reply was succinct: "Reestablishment of the rights of
the state against the church and with the least possible noise."87 It was the
tragedy of the German Kulturkampf that the actions of FaIk and Bismarck
went far beyond the mere reestablishment of the rights of the state against the
Catholic church and that they were accompanied by an uproar that reverberated throughout Germany and Europe for most of a decade. In seeking to
drive the church out of the sphere of the state, they seriously invaded the
sphere of the church and the rights of the individual. Far from separating
church and state, they heightened the authority of the state over the Catholic
church.
A few Kulturkampf laws did, it is true, contribute to the separation of
church and state—most notably the school supervision and compulsory civil
marriage statutes. While inspired by the immediate problems of Prussian Poland and the Braunsberg school controversy, the school supervision act of
1872 clarified the right of the state to control education in both public and
private schools. By confirming the state's power to appoint and remove
county and local school inspectors, it curbed the traditional, fiscally beneficial, practice of appointing clergymen to supervisory and teaching posts without remuneration.88 Obligatory civil marriage was introduced in Prussia in
March 1874 and, on the initiative of Reichstag liberals, in the entire Reich
in February 1875.89 While an avid supporter of the school supervision act,
Bismarck resisted compulsory civil marriage, foreseeing that it would alienate
Protestants as well as Catholics. He acquiesced only when FaIk threatened to
resign.
Most Kulturkampf legislation reinforced the supremacy of the state over the
church. The so-called "pulpit paragraph," an amendment to the Reich penal

code in December 1871 initiated by an anticlerical Bavarian government,
made clergymen punishable by two years imprisonment for political state­
ments "endangering the public peace." 90 An imperial statute of July 1872,
launched by the Reichstag, expelled the Jesuit order from the Reich. 91 Most
of the "conflict laws" were Prussian, not imperial statutes. In April 1873 two
amendments to the Prussian constitution made the Evangelical and Catholic
churches "subject to the laws of the state and to the legally established super­
vision of the state" and gave to the state the power to enact statutes regulating
the education, employment, and dismissal of clergymen, and to establish the
"limits of the disciplinary authority of the church." 92 This prepared the way
for the "May laws" of 1873 which: (1) stipulated that future clergymen of both
confessions must be "Germans" who had graduated from a German Gymna­
sium, studied for three years in a German university, and passed state exami­
nations in philosophy, history, and German literature (an experience in­
tended to guarantee loyalty to Germany rather than Rome); (2) declared that
only German ecclesiastical authorities could exercise disciplinary power over
clergy and subjected such disciplinary actions to review by the provincial gov­
ernor-general and by a new "royal court for church affairs"; (3) made appoint­
ments to ecclesiastical offices subject to the approval of the governor-general;
(4) subjected church officials guilty of violating the law to fines, imprison­
ment, and removal from office; (5) regulated and eased the conditions under
which a citizen might end his church affiliation.93
These statutes, which were roundly condemned by the Prussian bishops,
failed of their purpose. Rather than submit to state supervision of the training
of priests, the bishops closed the seminaries. Prospective priests neither at­
tended the universities nor took the prescribed state examinations. Instead of
seeking the government's approval of their nominees, the bishops left eccle­
siastical offices vacant. When fines were imposed, they went to jail rather
than pay. Confiscated property was repurchased at auction by loyal Catholics,
who restored it to the church. Diocesan financial records were hidden or de­
stroyed in order to keep them out of the hands of royal commissioners ap­
pointed to administer vacant dioceses. Although Catholic Landrdte were dis­
missed, the resistance of local and low-ranking state officials (including the
police) was too massive to be punished or terrorized. They disobeyed orders
94
from on high and openly sympathized with the priesthood.
By April 1874 Bismarck had already commenced to shift the blame for
failure onto his colleagues. It had never been his intention to engage in a
campaign against the Catholic church, he asserted to the Saxon minister
Baron Richard von Friesen. "I wanted to fight the Center as a political party,

nothing more! If they [the ministers] had limited themselves to that, it would
certainly have been successful. I am completely blameless for the fact that
they went further and aroused the whole Catholic population." He had been
too ill to read the "thick drafts" of prospective bills and cut out the "dumb
stuff" they contained.95 Yet legislation that Bismarck himself fostered in
1874-1875 alienated the Catholic population even more, without bringing
the government any closer to its goal.
Bismarck, it is often asserted, lacked an appreciation of moral forces in
public life.96 This is hardly true, for we have seen that after 1858 he came to
the conclusion that Prussian expansion could not be achieved without the
moral sanction of German nationalism and that his policies after 1866 were
based on that assumption. In the Kulturkampf he, paradoxically, both overestimated the moral force of Catholicism (the danger of an ultramontane crusade against Germany) and underestimated it (the tenacity with which Catholics would cling to their faith and church under political persecution). But
he also overestimated the immediate value of German nationalism (as an ally
in the struggle against political Catholicism) and underestimated it (as a force
for the eventual reconciliation of the Catholic opposition to the German
Reich). Indeed, Bismarck's tendency to look upon the papacy as a foreign
power commanding an ultramontane army and his frequent use of military
terminology in referring to the Kulturkampf explain why the struggle has been
likened to an "internal preventive war." Against Rome, as earlier against Vienna and Paris, he deliberately mobilized and exploited forces whose views
and passions he did not fully share, calling upon German national sentiment
to support and justify a policy conceived, or rather misconceived, in the interest of state.
The wars of unification, Syllabus of Errors, Vatican Council, and dogma of
infallibility had produced a steadily widening stream of religious controversy
in Germany; the actions of Bismarck and FaIk in 1871-1873 brought it to
flood stage. The press, public meetings, and parliaments were filled with contention, charges, and countercharges. In the views of the Kulturkampfer can

be seen all of the successive layers of the German intellectual experience from
the bedrock of religion to the topsoil of materialism. To liberal Protestants
(for example, Theodor Mommsen) the goal of the conflict was to complete
the Reformation and free 20 million German Catholics from the embrace of
ultramontanism. Nurtured in the philosophy of German idealism (often
called "the secret religion of the German educated class"), German nationalists viewed the conflict as a cosmic struggle between the German and Latin
spirits, between the German idea of freedom, manifested in the Protestant
Reformation and the neohumanism of the age of Goethe, and Roman authoritarianism, manifested in an absolute, infallible pope in search of world
dominion. Having achieved political unity, Germany must now attain spiritual unity, perhaps even a new national religion (Paul de Lagarde). Others of
the idealistic school (for example, Constantin Rossler) regarded the Kulturkampf as a defense of the state, seen in the Hegelian tradition as the vessel of
the Zeitgeist and embodiment of morality, a state that had reached its fullest
realization in the German Reich of 1871 under a Protestant monarchy. For
adherents of Realpolitik, who had discarded Hegelian metaphysics, on the
other hand, the issue was preservation of the authority of the sovereign state
and of positive law against a rebellious corporation and refractory individuals
within civil society. Although many realists were religious men (for example,
Heinrich von Treitschke), their position on the Kulturkampf was essentially
political, based on the presumed needs of the state rather than upon any ideal
or religious conception. For them the question was simple: which was to be
dominant over the state, the government or the Roman church?
Since mid-century realism, secularism, and materialism had been on the
ascent among the educated, fed by the simultaneous acceleration in German
industrial development, successive triumphs on the battlefield, and expanding awareness of advances in scientific knowledge. The materialistic viewpoint had been nourished by the popular writings of David Friedrich Strauss
depicting Christianity as a historical phenomenon, of Ernst Haeckel on social
Darwinism, and of Ludwig Biichner popularizing the natural sciences. A renewed faith in human progress had arisen, confident that the new scholarship
and new science would steadily unlock the secrets of history, society, and the
universe, banishing ignorance and superstition. To liberals of this conviction
the Syllabus of Errors and dogma of infallibility were a declaration of war
against progress, modern science, and even civilization itself—an intolerable
reversion to a medieval value system that the western world had long outgrown. It was in this sense that Rudolf Virchow, eminent scientist and parliamentary leader, dubbed the conflict a "struggle for culture."97

Germany did not divide in the 1870s cleanly into two camps, for and
against ultramontanism. Some liberals, much to the surprise and distress of
their own colleagues, were of the opinion that the liberal parties were seriously compromising their own credo by supporting exceptional laws (Ausnahmegesetze) against Catholics. It was true that many statutes could be interpreted with some elasticity as an intervention by the state to protect civil
liberties—the rights of the citizen against the churches (civil marriage statute), of renitent Catholics against the clergy (law on church affiliation), of
the lesser Catholic clergy against the higher (limitation of the church's disciplinary power). Yet this did not blind a small minority of national liberals
(Lasker, Bamberger) and progressives (about twelve, including Hoverbeck,
Richter, Franz Duncker) to the fact that most Kulturkampf laws, beginning
with the pulpit paragraph of November 1871, were an unjustifiable infringement of civil liberty and an unfortunate precedent for liberals and democrats.
"The hand that turns the skewer to the right," Richter warned, "can also turn
it to the left."»8
The most serious cleavage produced by the Kulturkampf was among conservatives. Protestant theologians who joined the struggle in the early months
became disillusioned in varying degrees by the company in which they found
themselves. Increasingly the Kulturkampf appeared to be a liberal rather than
a Protestant undertaking, a struggle of realists for the omnipotent state and of
materialists against all Christianity, rather than a renewal of the faith Luther
had begun. They were incensed by the apparent penetration of these attitudes
into the government itself. From Heinrich Friedberg, Prussian under secretary
in the Ministry of Justice and delegate to the Bundesrat, they heard, for example, that "mere morality" had to be considered secondary to what was expedient and necessary under existing circumstances." Through Muhler, furthermore, they learned that there was more to the government's policy than
met the eye, that Bismarck's campaign against Catholics masked an ulterior
purpose—a separation of church and state that would affect the Protestant as
well as the Catholic church.'°° Once more the piper in the Wilhelmstrasse
appeared to be leading conservatives toward the sacrifice of their most cherished principles.

Climax of the Liberal Era
Alienation of the ' 'Old Conservatives''
INCE the beginning of the nineteenth century Prussian conservatives had repeatedly compromised, willingly and unwillingly, their
twin ideals of the corporate society and Christian state. Under Bismarck the rate of sacrifice accelerated. In 1866 they swallowed the
indemnity bill and universal male suffrage and bit into the principle of legitimacy by accepting Prussia's annexations. During the North German Confederation they watched Bismarck's flirtation with liberal nationalists, his many
favors to industrial capitalism, and a flood of unifying legislation that depreciated the importance of Prussia, the power base of the conservative order.
We have seen that the conservative reaction to these developments varied
from total opposition (Ludwig von Gerlach) to full acceptance (the free conservatives). The cost was disunity, not only through the departure of the free
conservatives, but also through the internal fracturing of the Conservative
party itself. After 1867 each of the three caucuses of the Conservative party
(Reichstag, Prussian Chamber of Deputies, and Prussian House of Lords) had
its own political complexion.: While Reichstag conservatives tended to cooperate with the government, Landtag conservatives balked in 1867-1869
and were bludgeoned into submission by Bismarck's threats and Wilhelm's
disapproval.2 In 1872 two issues—the school supervision and county government reform acts—renewed their resentment.
The school inspection bill had been one of the chief bones of contention
between Bismarck and Kultusminister Muhler. On Bismarck's insistence it was
separated from the context of a general education reform bill and presented
to the Landtag in February 1872 as an "emergency law." The bill affirmed that
school inspection was a function of the state, not the churches, and clarified
the right of the state to appoint and dismiss school inspectors throughout the
monarchy, not merely in the eastern provinces. Eulenburg had warned Bismarck that the wide scope of the bill would cause many conservative Protestants to side with Catholics in opposition.3 And so it did. Conservatives

sensed correctly that Bismarck's purpose was to remove all clerical influence,
Protestant as well as Catholic, from the school system. In the debates of the
Chamber of Deputies in February 1872 they listened to the leaders of the leftliberals—Lasker, Richter, Virchow—praise the bill as a blow for freedom and
for separation of church and state. In the voting on February 13, many conservatives joined Center and Polish deputies against the measure, which
passed 207 to 155. Passage was never in doubt owing to the support of the free
conservatives, national liberals, and progressives, but the size of the conservative opposition boded ill for the measure in the House of Lords. During the
debate Bismarck warned that he would use "every constitutional means" to
secure passage in the upper chamber. This was a thinly veiled threat that the
king would name enough peers to overcome any opposition. On March 8 the
bill passed the House of Lords by a vote of 126 to 76.4
Landtag conservatives feared not only for the survival of the "Christian
state," jeopardized by the school inspection law, but also for that of the corporate state (Standestaat), jeopardized by the county reform bill. Since early
in the century few changes had occurred in county and local government in
the "old provinces" of Prussia. While losing their judicial power in 1848, the
owners of noble estates (Rittergutsbesitzer) had retained control over village
government and local police. In addition, each owner of such an estate possessed a seat in the county assembly (Kreistag), which controlled local taxes
and nominated three candidates from whom the king, acting through the
Ministry of Interior, chose the Landrat. The Landrat was both a royal official
and a representative, usually a member, of the local gentry. Since i860 liberal
legislators and publicists had constantly called for reform; many conservatives
found the system difficult to defend.5
During the dispute on the Hanoverian provincial fund Bismarck had
threatened conservatives with a reform bill that would break their stranglehold on rural government. Whether he would have carried out the threat is
doubtful. He wanted to expand the dominant social group by including men
of "social prominence," whose wealth was derived from sources other than
estates and to reduce bureaucratic control through greater local autonomy in
such matters as roads, social welfare, and local finance. Yet he balked at the
idea of granting to rural counties and communities the degree of autonomy
that cities had enjoyed since the Stein reforms early in the century. In many
cities, he maintained, the election of mayors had resulted in financial and
political corruption. Hence the "chief officials" of the county must be royal
appointees.6 Bismarck was too much the Junker and too much the authoritarian to become the heir of Stein.

While his aims were moderate, Bismarck had considerable difficulty in
launching a reform. His first obstacle was Count Eulenburg, whose Ministry
of Interior was responsible for drafting the bill. He respected Eulenburg's ability (a rare concession), but thought him lazy (a foible exploited by his subordinates to delay action) and too independent (not the best attribute for longevity in the Bismarck cabinet).7 When finally presented to the Landtag in
late 1869, the bill was too conservative for liberals and too liberal for conservatives. The debate dragged out: war intervened; the issue was shelved. After
the war Eulenburg found himself in the same dilemma as Miihler. In view of
Bismarck's pressure, something had to be accomplished; yet nothing could be
achieved in the Chamber of Deputies without support from the national liberals. Eulenburg's instinct for survival as a minister outweighed his conservatism, but he also relished the prospect of being ranked with Stein and Hardenberg as one of the great reformers of the Prussian political order. At any
rate the bill he introduced in the Landtag in December 1871 met the wishes
of national liberals and free conservatives andfinallywon, although for purely
tactical reasons, the votes of progressives.8
The statute abolished the police and administrative powers of the owners
of knights estates (Rittergutsbesitzer). Local and county government was reorganized on three levels: (1) the village, administered by a chairman (Gemeindevorsteher) and two aldermen (Schoffen) elected by the village and approved
by the Landrat; (2) the district, whose chairman (Amtsvorsteher) was elected
by the county assembly and appointed by the provincial governor-general
(Oberprdsident); and (3) the county, governed by a Landrat selected in the
traditional manner and assisted by an executive committee (Kreisausschuss)
chosen by the county assembly. The assembly was to be elected by a threeclass voting system (large landowners, burghers, and small farmers and laborers). The system combined in a unique way popular election, representative
bodies, and higher authority.9
Despite the enthusiasm of liberals, the reform was hardly revolutionary,
and many conservatives in the Chamber of Deputies found they could support
it. Hence the measure passed by an overwhelming majority (256 to 61) on
March 23, 1872, the minority consisting chiefly of estate owners and Landrdte
from the eastern provinces (including Bismarck's brother Bernhard!). In the
House of Lords, however, archconservatives of this type constituted the majority. After long debate the bill was overwhelmingly defeated (145 to 18) on

October 31, 1872.IO In the attacks of Kleist-Retzow, Count Lippe, and other
hotspurs of the "Stahl caucus," as the ultras called themselves, it is evident
that what disturbed the Junkers was not only loss of power, but also loss of
ideology. Since the beginning of the century every successive conservative
thinker had sought to buttress the concept of the Standestaat and preserve
institutions that were believed still to embody it. To accept abolition of manorialism was to admit the futility of the effort. What the ultras resisted was
not merely the sacrifice of special privileges, but also the whole transformation from status to class society that was the inexorable consequence of industrial and urban development.11
From Varzin, whence he had retired in May on the verge of collapse, Bismarck followed the struggle in the Landtag with mounting wrath. He had
anticipated, to be sure, that county reform would encounter greater difficulty
than the school inspection act. "That concerned questions in which the
evangelical Junker had no direct interest; this is a question of money and
influence in daily life." He was particularly outraged that Landrate and provincial governors who sat in the Chamber of Deputies had dared vote against the
bill in league with "revolutionary" elements "hostile to the government."12
Still, he sniffed among the odors of adversity the perfume of opportunity.
What mattered now was not Eulenburg's bill, which in any case was not entirely to Bismarck's taste, but a reform of the House of Lords itself. In messages
to Berlin he contended that the upper chamber was not fulfilling its proper
function as a protector of monarchical interests; instead it had become "antigovernmental" and "dangerous to the state." To pack the chamber with
enough new peers to secure passage of Eulenburg's bill would be a mere "palliative." Needed was a fundamental change in the composition of the chamber that would make it "similar to a state council [Staatsrat],"13 not a pale
imitation of the British House of Lords. While willing to permit hereditary
members in the chamber, he wished to replace other aristocratic peers with

Such a chamber would speak for the most important interests in Prussian society; it would carry greater weight in the Chamber of Deputies, and would
be inclined to support the government, particularly if its elective segment
were subject to dissolution.14

By giving reform of the House of Lords priority over county reform, Bismarck also hoped to unseat Eulenburg, another of those independent colleagues who obstructed his domination of the Prussian cabinet. In late October 1872 the minister appealed to Bismarck for assistance, explaining that he
was determined to bring about the county reform or fall in the attempt.15
Bismarck's reply was a harsh letter of the kind that often preceded the departure of a hapless minister. He excoriated his "honored friend" for having failed
to discipline and purge officials (Landrcite and provincial governors) who had
opposed the school inspection and county reform statutes; the Landrat for
Varzin, for example, had characterized the chancellor as "an incompetent and
unchristian minister." "I believe that your leniency has contributed not inconsiderably to the debasement of society." Instead of performing his duties,
Eulenburg was "beating on the skull of a sick man, in the hope of striking off
a phosphorescent spark."16
Eulenburg, however, knew how to help himself. Ignoring the poisoned
darts flying from Varzin, ' 7 he pushed through the cabinet, over the opposition
of ministers Roon and Selchow, slight modifications of the county reform bill
sufficient to meet conservative objections and an agreement to force its passage through the upper chamber by naming twenty-four new peers (loyal generals and high officials). By this Pairschub, Eulenburg wished "to break the
opposition once and for all," easing passage not only of the county reform act
but also of upcoming Kulturkampf laws that were unpopular among conser26. Ernst Feder, ed., Bismarcks grosses Spiel: Die geheimen Tagebucher Ludwig Bambergers (Frankfurt, 1933), p. 200. Under a statute of May 30, 1855, the House of Lords was composed of (1)
royal princes of the house of Hohenzollern appointed by the king (none was ever appointed); (2)
hereditary members drawn from the high nobility, including heads of the south German families
of Hohenzollern-Hechingen and Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, 22 mediatized (that is, former imperial) houses, and 51 other noble houses; (3) heads of noble families possessing noble estates
and granted hereditary membership by the king (41 seats by 1911); (4) members appointed for
life (largely high officials, officers, and clerics, numbering 88 by 1911); (5) members chosen by
certain organizations possessing the right of representation. In the latter category were chapters
of three evangelical cathedrals, associations of nobles bearing the hereditary title of "count" in
each of the eight provinces, certain distinguished noble families with such names as Alvensleben,
Arnim, Bredow, Kleist, andSchwerin (18 seats by 1911), fifty-six associations formed by owners
of noble estate· that had been in the possession of the same family for at least fifty years (altogether 90 seats), professors of ten Prussian universities, and certain city governments (51 by
1911). In 1911 the chamber was composed of 347 members, of whom 260 were noblemen, 87
were burghers. Of the burghers most were officials, academicians, mayors, and businessmen, but
no representatives of farmers or laborers, except for one artisan (appointed in 1911). Ernst Rudolf

vatives.,8 Wilhelm was agreeable. He feared that a reformed House of Lords
would become "a skiff bobbing in the wake of the Chamber of Deputies battleship," and Bismarck was too far away to change the Kaiser's mind.IQ After
repassing the lower chamber comfortably, the bill was approved by the House
of Lords on December 7 by a margin of twenty-five votes. Eulenburg rejoiced
that he might go down in history as the "rejuvenator of Prussia."20
The county reform bill proved in practice to be less of a change than its
liberal supporters imagined and its conservative opponents feared. It ended
manorialism by severing the formal connection between political privilege
and ownership of noble estates, but did not liquidate the power of the gentry
as such. Big landowners continued to dominate county assemblies in the eastern provinces and tended to monopolize the new office of district chairman,
which controlled the police. While county governments enjoyed greater autonomy, ultimate authority still rested with the central government acting
through the Landrat. Increasingly the position of Landrat was held by professional officials rather than by members of the local gentry, who generally
lacked the legal and administrative training the post now required. Still, more
than half of those who held the office in 1914 were Junkers.21
The struggles of 1872 shattered the unity of the Conservative party. Embarrassed by the position of Landtag conservatives on the school inspection
bill, the Reichstag caucus renamed itself the "Monarchical-National party"
and announced its intention to work "hand in hand" with the Bismarck regime.22 In the Landtag those deputies who voted for the county reform bill
adopted the title "New Conservative party" to make clear their disagreement
with the "old conservatives," who sided with the intransigents of the House
of Lords. The most dramatic consequence of the school inspection and county
reform acts, however, was the open break that now ensued between Bismarck
and ultraconservatives, some of whom, like Kleist-Retzow, had been lifelong
friends and associates. To the ultras the conduct of Bismarck and Eulenburg
constituted a betrayal of trust highly damaging not only to the gentry, but also
to the "Christian state" and the monarchy itself.23 To Bismarck, on the other
hand, it was utterly incomprehensible that conservatives could think of op18

posing the government. In his vocabulary the ultras were now "enemies of
the state," a phrase he previously reserved for democrats, socialists, ultramontanes, and Guelphs.

Deteriorating Health
Bismarck's struggles with cabinet, king, and ultraconservatives during 1872
left him in a state of nervous exhaustion. On May 3 his physician, Heimrich
Struck, penned a dire warning. The chancellor was suffering, he wrote, "from
functional disturbances in almost all bodily organs." Declining strength and
nervous exhaustion could lead to a "premature marasmus." The patient had
lived for many years off the "capital of his nervous system." Income and outgo
were not in balance. Against his own better judgment the doctor had frequently sought to assist either with stimulants or depressants. "But now I must
tell you that I have reached the end of what medicine can accomplish with
palliatives." Struck advised the prince to take a leave of absence lasting at
least six months, during which time he must be relieved of all duties.24
How Bismarck diagnosed his problem can be seen in a number of sources.
Lucius had never seen him "more grim and out of sorts" than at a parliamentary soiree on May 4. "My oil is used up; I can't any more," he complained.
"It is too much to work alone with such colleagues and against the influence
of the queen." Parliament also caused him distress by its "incomprehension of
conditions." Foreign powers lacked initiative. "We now make the events in
Europe and, if we do nothing, then nothing happens." "My sleep gives me no
rest. I dream about what I have thought about while awake, if I go to sleep at
all. Recently I saw a map of Germany in front of me, on which one rotten
spot appeared after another and then fell away."25
One week later his mood had not improved. At the soiree on May 11 Gustav von Diest—government official, conservative deputy, and frequent guest
in the Bismarck household—approached the chancellor and chanced to remark that his host must be feeling better. "It is just my misfortune that I never
find sympathy!" was the response. He had paced the floor all night, the prince
declared, falling asleep only at 8:30 in the morning, awaking at 3:00 P.M.
"But the sleep was not refreshing. And now [I have] this pressure on my brain
that makes everything that lies behind my eyes often seem like a glutinous
mass. I am not able to hold on to my thoughts continuously. In addition,
there is this unbearable pressure on my stomach, with unspeakable pains."
Diest advised cold compresses on head and torso. Bismarck replied, "I know
that [treatment]; they call it 'Neptune's belt.' I used it carefully, as prescribed,
but the only results were new colds and nervous symptoms." Diest proposed

214

* A Time for "Liberalism," 1871-1875 *

yet another remedy. Being "much more choleric" than other men, Bismarck
should "lie face down for eight days," which might bring him "eight weeks of
good health." At this, the prince became furious. "I tell you that my nerves
are at the breaking point, and the doctors have forecast a nervous breakdown,
if I do not take some months now to relax completely."26
On May 14, 1872, Diest met the chancellor in an anteroom of the Reichstag and found him confused about the day of the week. Didn't the prince feel
better, he asked, now that a vacation was in prospect? "With a deep tragicmelancholic expression," Bismarck replied, "No, I feel worse than ever today;
I fear a stroke. It is all over with me." With a deep sigh he shook the deputy's
hand and left him to enter the chamber, where a few minutes later, to Diest's
astonishment, he delivered two highly effective (judging from frequent laughter and applause) attacks against the ultramontanes. It was on this occasion
that he spoke those ringing words, "Don't worry; we are not going to Canossa,
neither physically nor spiritually," which resonated in the daily press but later
returned to haunt him.27 Small wonder that Diest and others concluded that
Bismarck's ailments were laced with hypochondria.
Wilhelm granted Bismarck's request for an extended leave, and on May 18
he left Berlin for Varzin, where he remained, with but one interruption, for
nearly seven months. In his absence Delbriick transacted the routine business
of the empire, and Roon assumed Bismarck's duties in the Prussian cabinet.
With Bucher's secretarial help, Bismarck continued to conduct foreign affairs.
In late June he wrote to his daughter that he could dispose of Europe in ten
to fifteen minutes every morning at breakfast, "since no one is here to make
matters difficult." Letters to his family tell of long walks and rides to inspect
the timber, of sleeping eleven hours "like a sack," of Sultan's adventures
(chained up at night so as not to disturb his master, the mastiff bit and clawed
his way to freedom), of his plans for adding a new wing to the mansion, and
of Struck who seemed to bring his illnesses with him. The doctor was besieged
in "this normally healthy region" by patients with broken bones, hemorrhages, and other ailments. "Only Bucher and I refuse obstinately to take any
of his medicines."28
In late July he had a visitor, John Lothrop Motley, who found his old Gottingen friend "little changed in appearance since '64, which surprises me. He
is somewhat stouter and his face more weather-beaten, but as expressive and
powerful as ever. . . . He looks like a Colossus, but his health is somewhat
shattered. He can never sleep until four or five in the morning. Of course,
work follows him here, but as far as I have yet seen it seems to trouble him

215

but little. He looks like a country gentleman entirely at leisure."29 Indeed
Bismarck had become stouter. A suit ordered for his silver wedding anniversary (July 28) proved too small, being based on measurements taken in 1868.
This may have cost the tailor himself some sleep, for he received from the
mighty chancellor of the German Empire a sharp rebuke: "You . . . assume
that I become smaller and thinner with age, which is seldom the case. . . . I
did not expect that a business such as yours, ordinarily so intelligently conducted, could have studied so little the natural history of the human body."3°
As the summer neared its end, Bismarck asserted that his health was not
much better than in the spring. "Until now," he confessed, "I have been
unable to work." Johanna too was ailing, though she sought to hide it, and
Bismarck anticipated that they would remain at Varzin "for most of the winter." In September he was compelled to attend the Berlin meeting at which
the three emperors formed their league. He endured the negotiations, banquets, and other festivities, but sped back to Varzin on September 19. During
October he felt stronger and, disregarding the instructions of his physician,
entered at long distance into the fray over the county reform bill—only to
suffer a severe relapse. The conduct of the ultras made him boil with anger,
as did Eulenburg's success in evading the trap set for him. That Wilhelm followed Eulenburg's advice, not Bismarck's, in packing the House of Lords was
doubly upsetting.3' Bismarck's vexation was self-defeating, for it made him
too ill to undertake a journey to Berlin in November, when his presence alone
could have altered the situation. Instead Struck had to be summoned to Varzin by telegraph on November 10. "I fear that I am more used up than I have
admitted to myself," the prince wrote to Wilhelm three days later. "I am
ashamed not to be at my post at such an important moment."32
On December 14, 1872, the news of a fresh cabinet crisis compelled Bismarck, despite his poor condition, to leave the quiet of Varzin for the clamor
of Berlin. Piqued on being outvoted by the other ministers, Roon and SeIchow wanted to resign. Their departure would have jeopardized the delicate
balance in the cabinet between conservatives (Roon, Selchow, Itzenplitz, Eulenburg) and liberals (Camphausen, FaIk, Leonhardt). It would have confirmed the prejudices of those Prussian conservatives who believed that Bismarck had sold out to liberalism. There was no reason to regret Selchow's

exit, to be sure, for his was a modest talent. But the departure of Roon—after
Bismarck the cabinet's most prestigious member—would have been highly
damaging. Faced with this threat, the prince made a decision he had contemplated for months: to lighten his burdens by resigning as Prussian ministerpresident in order to concentrate his energies on imperial affairs. By handing
over to Roon the highest office in the Prussian government, moreover, he
pumped up the general's ego and kept him in the cabinet.33
Yet this is not all that was at stake. On the day before his departure from
Vanin, Bismarck wrote a revealing letter to Roon. "My profession is such that
one makes many enemies, but no new friends." Honesty and fearlessness had
cost him old friendships. "I am in disfavor among all members of the royal
house, and the trust of the king in me is declining. Every intriguer finds his
ear." The treasonable desertion of the Conservative party in the Catholic
question had deprived him of the political base he preferred. "Given my age
and my conviction that I do not have long to live, there is something discouraging in this world about the loss of old friends and associations. When
coupled with concern about [the health] of my wife, which has returned in
increased measure in recent months, this discouragement is crippling. My
springs have lost their tension from being overtaxed. . . . The king hardly
knows how shamelessly he has ridden a good horse. . . . The influences that
counter my efforts are too powerful for me, and the malicious vanity and political uselessness of the conservatives have deprived me since last year of all
joy in the struggle. Nothing can be done with the conservatives; they follow
'speakers' like Kleist and intriguers like Bodelschwingh. I can't do anything
against them."34
Except for brief excursions to Friedrichsruh and Varzin and a two-week official visit to St. Petersburg in May, Bismarck remained at his post in Berlin
from December 14, 1872 to June 27, 1873. From January to May he was
plagued by pains in leg, hip, and throat; at times he could neither walk nor
stand. At the end of June he retired, "drained of all energy and will," to
Vanin, "where I don't need to see or speak to anyone for fourteen days at a
stretch." Bismarck had not succeeded, despite his surrender of the ministerpresidency, in ridding himself of the burden of Prussian affairs, and Wilhelm
refused his request to be relieved of his last remaining cabinet post, that of
Prussian minister of foreign affairs. Instead he tried to recover his strength
once more during a lengthy vacation in the country. Thrice it was interrupted
by unavoidable travels: to Berlin in early September 1873 for the unveiling of
the victory column in the Konigsplatz; to Berlin again in late September,
despite "rheumatic-nervous pains," to receive the king of Italy and his foreign

217

minister; to Vienna in October with Wilhelm on a state visit. Afterward he
returned to Varzin "acutely sick." In November he was besieged by a throat
ailment; the doctors suspected diphtheria.35
Since midOctober 1873 Bismarck had been depressed by the news that
Roon, now seventy-one years old and asthmatic, had finally resigned on
grounds of poor health. After less than a year of experimentation, it was evident that the attempt to separate chancellorship and minister-presidency was
a failure. Reluctantly Bismarck again became the presiding officer of the Prussian cabinet. But Roon's departure was also a keen personal blow to the
prince. It was upon Roon's shield that he had been elevated into office in
1862, and the two had been closely associated for nearly a dozen years. Since
1866 Roon had not always been happy over the course steered by his friend
in domestic affairs, particularly over Bismarck's collaboration with German
liberals and "Verdeutschung a tout prix." Yet Roon had accepted the school
inspection and county reform acts and, as minister-president, had even presided over the drafting and passage of the May laws of 1873. The letter Bismarck wrote to Roon on hearing of the latter's resignation shows genuine
pathos. The general was, he said, the "one remaining feeling heart" among
the ministers. "The longer I remain in office the more lonely I become; the
old friends die or become enemies and one makes no more new ones."36
Bismarck's sense of loss and isolation was heightened by yet another disappointment—his failure to bring into the cabinet Moritz von Blanckenburg,
his old friend of Kniephof days, with whom he had once shared a love for
Marie von Thadden. Blanckenburg was perhaps the most effective of those
moderate conservative leaders in Reichstag and Landtag who had, despite
frequent grumbling and dissent, refused to follow the ultras in breaking with
the Bismarck government. A description of his attitude written by his sisterin-law in these years mirrors the ambivalence of moderate conservatives in
general: "Vexed though he is at Bismarck, he is too attached to be able to
break with him entirely. Moreover, he has had too much opportunity to get
to know the conservatives and appreciate their intellectual poverty, their egoism and incapacity, not to see blame on both sides." When Selchow resigned
in the fall of 1872, as minister of agriculture, Bismarck proposed that he be
replaced by Blanckenburg, hoping through him to cement his relationship to
the moderate conservatives. Blanckenburg, who was initially favorable to the
appointment, expected to push the government in a conservative direction.
Since 1869 Blanckenburg and Hermann Wagener had been urging Bismarck
to create a new conservative party based on landowners, artisans, and proletarians; such a party, they argued, would enable the government to ditch its

alliance with the national liberals. But FaIk ended Blanckenburg's candidacy
by threatening to leave the cabinet rather than accept him as a colleague.37
Count Konigsmarck, who received the appointment, lasted less than a
year, and in November 1873 Bismarck succeeded in getting even FaIk to accept Blanckenburg's candidacy. But by this time Blanckenburg had changed
his mind. The May laws had made him more critical of the government's
course, which, he now realized, he could not change as a cabinet member.
He was not impressed, furthermore, by Bismarck's argument that as a minister
he need concern himself only with agriculture, not politics. The presence of
Camphausen as minister of finance seemed to guarantee that economic policy
would continue to favor industry and trade rather than farming. Blanckenburg not only refused to become Bismarck's colleague, but also gave up his
seat in the Reichstag to return "like salmon from the sea" to his estate in
Pomerania. "For the time being," he wrote to Roon, "nothing is to be accomplished with political parties. Bismarck has destroyed every bridge in Pomerania that I could have still rebuilt." Bismarck was bitter over this fresh apostasy. "Blanckenburg's party loyalty," he complained to Roon, "is greater than
his devotion to king and country." "God has permitted the desertion of our
Junkers from throne and faith and thereby badly damaged our armor."38
By the end of 1873 Bismarck was chronically ill and doubted that he had
long to live; he felt isolated and alone, deserted by his oldest friends and by
most of his social class. The forced resignation of Hermann Wagener (discussed later) was another cruel blow, costing him the services of "the only
person around me with whom I can speak without restraint."39 Although severely depressed, Bismarck's narcissistic self-assurance was unshaken; he
firmly believed that the path he followed was the only viable one, that those
who opposed him were malevolent, and that those who failed to help him
were lacking in loyalty and patriotism. The self-image he painted in the letter
to Roon was that of his paternal ancestors, of a feudal warrior standing in the
breach determined to hold the wall against all assailants. "Sick or healthy I
will hold up the flag of my feudal lord against my factious cousins as firmly as
against Pope, Turks, and Frenchmen."40 In mid-December he returned to
Berlin "to undergo the chronic suffering of parliamentary activity," calling on
God to provide the "armor of disdain" needed to protect him from the attacks
of his fellowmen. "Our opponents," he wrote to Julius Andrassy, "are infinitely superior to us because they lack education and knowledge of affairs,
goodwill and patriotism, and they have the advantage that they serve only

themselves and the party to which they belong, not the country and not the
king. The struggle is very unequal, but it must be fought."41
The Elections of 1873-1874
His feud with the conservatives made Bismarck all the more dependent upon
the National Liberal party. Without its support there was no prospect of winning the Kulturkampf or continuing the consolidation of the Reich. By 1874
this dependency began to seem ominous owing to the growing power of the
party's left wing and of its principal spokesman, Eduard Lasker.
Lasker was born in 1829 at Jaroscyn in Posen. His family was Jewish and
middle class, his father a small manufacturer. As a student in Vienna Lasker
fought at the barricades in the ranks of the Academic Legion. The coming of
the new era in 1858 enabled him to begin his career as a Prussian official
(judiciary) at Berlin. He soon became prominent as a journalist in the liberal
press and was elected to the Prussian Chamber of Deputies in 1865 and to the
Reichstag in 1867. In both parliaments he quickly established his reputation
as a fearless and effective speaker, particularly upon issues of civil rights and
parliamentary power. Although eagerness for national unity led him from the
Progressive into the National Liberal party in 1866-1867, he remained close
in political temperament to the progressives. Many moderate liberals regarded
«• GW, XIV, 857-858.

220

* A Time for "Liberalism," 1 8 7 1 - 1 8 7 5 *

him as far too radical for the National Liberal party; yet he maintained a close
personal relationship with Bennigsen.42
During 1873 Lasker reached the peak of his career as a deputy. In JanuaryFebruary his revelations in the Prussian chamber of corruption in the granting
of railway concessions forced the resignation of Hermann Wagener, who was
morally and financially ruined by the charge. Another victim was Count Itzenplitz, whose Ministry of Commerce was responsible for granting the concessions. In April the Reichstag passed, by overwhelming majority, a bill long
advocated by Lasker to include civil law within the legislative competence of
the Reich. On June 13, the Reichstag resolved on his initiative to begin its
annual sessions in October rather than February, and on the following day the
government bill creating an Imperial Railway Office was passed only after he
had put through significant amendments. These achievements and the publicity they received made Lasker the most discussed German politician of the
year.43
Naturally this did not endear him to Bismarck. To be sure, the two men
were of one mind concerning the necessity of much of the centralizing legislation of the period, and Bismarck considered the imperial law codes to be a
highly important contribution to national unity. Yet he had hardly forgotten
Lasker's interference in the delicate negotiations with south German governments during 1870. He resented, furthermore, the loss of Wagener (but not
Itzenplitz!), and was inclined to interpret Lasker's assault on the Geheimrat as
an attack upon himself. ("You came within a hair of hitting me.")44 What
irritated Bismarck the most, however, was Lasker's persistent success in
amending government legislation. Until a Lasker amendment had been accepted, he later complained, government bills had no chance of passage.45
How sensitive Bismarck was to Lasker's growing influence was evident during the Reichstag debate of June 16, 1873, on the government's bill for an
imperial press act. Lasker objected to the brief time allotted for discussing a
measure involving "the rights of the people" and added that the bill had no
chance of passage; fewer than two dozen deputies favored it. Coming from
Lasker, who was seconded by Windthorst, this assessment of the bill's chances
was devastating. It provoked Bismarck to denounce Lasker's "declamation"
about civil rights as "outmoded talk." "All who sit here are representatives of

the people; we all belong to the people; I too have civil rights; his majesty the
Kaiser also belongs to the people; we are all people." In rebuttal Lasker interpreted the chancellor's attack as an attempted "put down" and a denial of
parliament's right to oppose the government. "We are on a footing of complete equality here." Each deplored the "tone" that the other had imparted to
the discussion, and Bismarck spoke of his sense of "injury" that any deputy
could talk to him in this acidulous way. Hohenlohe judged that both men
were in the wrong, "but particularly Bismarck."46
That Bismarck came to hate Lasker as much as he did Windthorst shows
how threatened he felt by a parliamentary leader who was not overawed by
his achievements, who refused to be impressed by his claims of bad health and
injured nerves, who possessed debating skills equal to his own, who was
moved more by principle than expediency, and who, because of the following
he attracted, threatened the chancellor's power and influence over the internal political life of the country. When not carried away by anger, as was obviously the case on June 16, Bismarck understood the necessity of getting
along with Lasker, at least for the time being. Five days later he sent Lasker a
special invitation to his parliamentary soiree, where he ostentatiously engaged the "little doctor" in a lengthy conversation that was duly reported in
the public press.47 By the end of the year he had even more cause to fear this
man, whose abilities he privately respected.48 The elections held in Prussia in
October—November 1873 and in Germany on January 10, 1874, created for
Lasker—or appeared to create for him—a commanding position in German
politics.
In these elections, held nearly three years after the start of the Kulturkampf, Bismarck and his liberal allies had their first chance to judge the effectiveness of their attack upon the Center party and Catholic hierarchy, while
conservatives learned the consequences of being at odds with the Bismarck
government, which failed, for the first time since 1862, to intervene in behalf
of conservative candidates.49 In both legislatures the Conservative party virtually collapsed, sinking from 55 to 22 seats in the Reichstag and from 114 to
30 seats in the Chamber of Deputies (the most severe loss being that of the
old conservatives, who sank from 71 to 4). Even the free conservatives suffered losses, declining from 41 to 35 in Prussia and 37 to 33 in the Reich.

Catholic voters rallied to the defense of church and party, with the consequence that the centrists increased from 58 to 88 in the Chamber of Deputies
and from 61 to 91 in the Reichstag. The liberal parties were the biggest winners, the national liberals rising from 123 to 174 in Prussia and from 125 to
155 in the Reich; for the progressives the increase was from 49 to 68 and 46
to 49. Among smaller parties, the Poles held their old strength at 18 seats in
the Chamber of Deputies and 14 seats in the Reichstag, while the Reichsland
sent 15 deputies to the Reichstag, where they formed a separate caucus of
"protesters." The Liberal Reich party, composed of 30 southern deputies in
1871, disappeared from the Reichstag. In both elections it was evident that
the Kulturkampf had polarized the voters. Protestants voted for liberals
(chiefly national liberals); Catholics, for centrists. For the first time since
1866 the two liberal parties had an absolute majority in both parliaments (242
out of 432 in the Chamber of Deputies, and 204 out of 397 in the Reichstag).' 0
In the Reichstag, however, there were other conceivable combinations.
Since the Kulturkampf had driven the Center into an attitude of "decisive
opposition," progressives had the possibility of hammering together a coalition of dissidents (progressives, centrists, Poles, social democrats, and other
assorted "Reichsfeinde") numbering 184 deputies. When joined by only fifteen
national liberals, such a coalition could, if incapable of constructive action,
at least block legislation proposed by the government. In other words, the left
wing of the National Liberal party (about eighteen deputies) led by Eduard
Lasker held the pivotal position in the chamber. By combining either with
the moderate-conservative or the radical-oppositional side of the chamber, it
might swing the chamber. "In such situations," wrote Eugen Richter, "the
decisive role had passed from Bennigsen and his followers to Lasker and his
followers. More than any previous deputy, Lasker dominated both the Reichstag and Chamber of Deputies during the ensuing legislative period."51
Renewal of the Iron Budget
The great issue of German politics in the mid-18 70s was whether and how
Lasker would exploit the pivotal position he appeared to have gained in national politics. Would this dedicated liberal seek to enlarge the range of parliament's authority at the risk of splitting the National Liberal party? The
crucial test was not long in coming, for the first great task of the empire's
second Reichstag was to decide on whether the "iron budget" of Germany's
military establishment, granted for three years in 1867 and again for three

years in 1871, was to be renewed. No other issue was so close to the heart of
the problem of parliamentary power.
Wilhelm and the Prussian War Ministry proposed to regain the ground lost
to the constituent Reichstag in 1867. Under the bill presented to the Reichstag in February 1874 the strength of the peacetime army was established indefinitely at 401,659 men. Until the government requested a further increase,
the size of the army and therefore its cost (constituting 90 percent of the
imperial budget) was to be outside parliament's control. The bill's opponents
had some reason for confidence. In 1871 all of the deputies in the Progressive,
Center, and Polish caucuses had voted against the iron budget and had been
joined by a number of national liberals, including Lasker. Given the new
composition of the chamber, the prospects of this combination were good.
Hoping for a quick decision, the progressive leader Hoverbeck proposed that
the bill be discussed in plenum without being referred to committee. But the
Reichstag chose the latter course and the bill did not reach the chamber until
after the Easter vacation. During the interim members of the Free Conservative and National Liberal parties sought escape from the approaching confrontation by proposing compromises in the form of substantially lower figures
than that proposed by the government. The conservative and official press
agitated vociferously for passage without compromise.52
During most of March and April 1874 Bismarck was confined to his quarters too lame to walk. According to Struck, the illness stemmed from the old
leg injury and began as an "abnormal" attack of gout. "Initially swelling of
the veins, inflammations, great pain, later the passing of much sediment and
uric acid, etc. No fever, pulse never above 64, heart beat and tone are constantly weak." The doctor prescribed morphine (one-twelfth of a gram) to
induce sleep and whiskey and gin as a diuretic 53 Bismarck's diagnosis was
different. What made him sick, he told Baron von Friesen, the Saxon envoy,
was vexation—"vexation not at his enemies and political opponents, with
whom he knew how to cope, but at those who ought to support him in their
own interests and for the good of the country, but who everywhere harmed
him and left him in the lurch."54
Unlike November 1872, Bismarck's illness in 1874 did not render him politically ineffective. Through two friendly deputies he issued what amounted
to an ultimatum to the liberal opposition. Apparently the time had come, the
Spenersche Zeitung quoted him as saying, to take back those confident words
he had uttered in March 1867: that Germany, if lifted into the saddle, would
know how to ride. "The Reichstag seems to want to prove that Germany can
not ride." Prominent deputies appeared to think themselves bound by earlier

commitments to abolish the iron budget. By contrast, he, Bismarck, had always sought to learn and had never hesitated to change his opinions when
the situation demanded, "for I have always placed the fatherland above myself." Deputies chosen by the electorate expressly to support the chancellor
were now betraying their constituents. "I cannot accept this situation. I cannot sacrifice my European reputation. As soon as I am able to grasp the pen,
I shall submit my resignation." But at the end his choices were stated somewhat differently: "either my resignation or the Reichstag's dissolution!"55
Bismarck, dissatisfied with the report in the Spenersche Zeitung, launched a
clarification of his position in the semiofficial Norddeutsche Attgemeine Zeitung:
"The strength and position of the Progressive party and of the portion of the
National Liberal party that goes with it has made the situation intolerable";
fifty to sixty deputies chosen by districts loyal to the Reich were "operating
against the imperial government, and this at a time when parties hostile to
the Reich are so strong that majorities are bound to fluctuate." This "bad
situation" was destined to grow worse rather than better during the coming
legislative period. Hence the chancellor had come to the opinion that the
only solution was an appeal to the voters, which, if unsuccessful, would prove
that "a constant majority upon which any government can support itself is
totally impossible." In another "correction" written for the Spenersche Zeitung,
Lucius wrote, "[Bismarck] no longer feels strong enough to overcome official
frictions and the difficulties created by a fluctuating majority in the Reichstag." Again the prince threatened resignation.56 The Kaiser also made his
sentiments known. On the occasion of his birthday (March 22), he told his
generals how sad it made him in the "evening of life" to have his authority in
military affairs questioned again by a parliamentary opposition. On the same
day he told a Reichstag delegation that he was firmly resolved, if necessary,
once more to take up the struggle against parliament.57
Again the liberal front buckled under the weight of the chancellor's displeasure. Most liberals (including some progressives) still considered him indispensable, at least in foreign affairs. They were impressed by his claim that
the state of his health (the Spenersche Zeitung carried a full report of his ailments) was too precarious to put up with internal opposition on crucial matters. No one relished having to appeal to the country on such an issue as the
size and support of the German army only three years after war with France.
It was evident that in the recent elections the public had reacted to the issues
of the Kulturkampf; they had voted for liberal rather than conservative candidates under the assumption that to do so was to support Bismarck in his
struggle against the "foes of the Reich." The chancellor was probably accurate

in judging that fifty to sixty national liberals would lose their seats in any
earnest contest with the government over the military issue. They had been
sent to the Reichstag to support the government in its struggle against ultramontanes, not to seek an enlargement of the chamber's budgetary power. The
pivotal position gained by Lasker and his allies did not stem from the will of
the electorate but from an accident of party politics. It existed in the structure
of the chamber, not in the minds of German voters.58
As the days passed, the weakness of the liberal position became increasingly
evident. A flood of petitions from all parts of Germany and all social classes
(including peasants, workers, and day laborers), advised the Reichstag to accept the bill.59 Gradually the national liberal press joined conservative and
official journals in urging settlement. Not since 1848, declared Bennigsen,
had he witnessed a popular political movement "so strong and primitive."
One party colleague, Eduard Stephani, detected "a veritable fanaticism for
unconditional acceptance of the statute." Richter, leader of the unconditional opposition, was likewise impressed by passions that the statements from
Bismarck and Wilhelm aroused and the press tendentiously exploited. When
the entire governmental apparatus (from top to bottom) beat the drums, he
remarked, the noise was loud enough to deafen some and shatter the weak
nerves of others.60 Once again, liberals were compelled to face the truth: the
German public was basically unconcerned about the issue of parliamentary
power, especially when the issue had to do with the army. "Most voters,"
reported the Spenersche Zeitung, "want no conflict with the government and
have made this wish clear to their deputies."61
By April 9, 1874, when the deputies reassembled after the Easter vacation,
the opposition bloc had begun to dissolve. Lasker found that his group of
thirty followers had shrunk to about fifteen. Progressives, furthermore, informed him that six of their members could not be relied upon. Seven members of the Alsace-Lorraine "protest party" were boycotting the parliament.62
Still, the great majority of the national liberals would probably have stood
with the progressives against the bill, if the government had continued to
insist on a permanent military budget. On March 30, however, the Kaiser
had summoned Forckenbeck, president of the Reichstag, and hinted at his
willingness to compromise on this issue.63 During the next ten days Forcken58

beck, Miquel, Bennigsen, and the Kaiser were repeatedly in Bismarck's sickroom. At the critical caucus of the National Liberal party on the evening of
April 9, these three leaders proposed a "compromise" in the form of a sevenyear military budget, which was unanimously approved.64 Eduard Stephani
described the scene among national liberals on the following day, when word
arrived that the Kaiser had accepted the offer: "jubilation without precedent,
much running about hither and yon. I ran to Miquel; we rejoiced greatly. . . .
Everyone was happy that the conflict wanted by the Center and conservatives
and feared by us had been avoided. The conservatives are outraged."65
During the first week in April 1874 Lasker faced his moment of truth. He
too decided to desert Richter and the progressives in their demand for a yearly
military budget. He wanted a four-year period, but yielded without joy to the
"compromise" that his colleagues obtained. Dedicated liberal though he was,
he recognized that the cause was lost; he could not command the votes with
which to insist on a more generous settlement. But he also was plagued by the
thought that, by persisting in opposition, he would only precipitate the split
within the party that had nearly occurred over the same issue in 1871.66 On
April 14, the new iron budget or Septennat was approved in the Reichstag by
a vote of 224 to 146. The majority was composed principally of conservatives,
free conservatives, national liberals, and some progressives. The minority was
composed of progressives, centrists, social democrats, Poles, and Guelphs.67
To Bennigsen Bismarck appeared, despite his illness, "as fresh, energetic,
and full of genius as ever, and in this affair he has executed a masterpiece from
his sickbed."68 Indeed the chancellor had cause for satisfaction. He had no
real desire to dissolve the Reichstag. Such a course, he confessed to Lucius,
would greatly embitter the minority and split the majority, both of which he
needed for the rest of his legislative program. "I cannot depend upon the
conservatives alone, without making concessions to the Center; yet I would
do it, if what I would win thereby were a real gold coin and not just a shiny
penny." By surrendering the Aetemat, on the other hand, he was assured of a
secure majority. The Septennat, furthermore, would extend beyond the next
two Reichstag elections, and it was difficult to make definite plans for a longer
time. But he also confessed to Lucius that, in forcing the military to accept
the Septennat, he had been compelled to threaten resignation. A seven-year

military budget would enable him to keep some control over the army, that
"state within a state." The military cabinet would be less inclined to ignore
the chancellor and Prussian Ministry of War if it knew that in the not too
distant future the generals would again need their support against parliament.69 Here is to be seen the familiar pattern of balance and counterbalance
characteristic of Bismarckian RecdpoUtik.
Again Bismarck had triumphed over a seemingly formidable parliamentary
opposition. The result showed that in any serious confrontation with his liberal "allies" on the issue of military defense versus parliamentary power he
held the upper hand, because he, not they, had the greater backing of vocal
public opinion. If unequal to him on such an issue, there was always the possibility, even likelihood, that the liberal majority would prove troublesome
on other issues, such as civil rights, in which the emotions of the public were
not so deeply engaged. During the same session, however, the government
succeeded in maneuvering the Reichstag liberals into still another "compromise." The imperial press act, over which Bismarck and Lasker had quarreled
in 1873, was reintroduced in 1874. On the occasion of its second reading in
March, the Reichstag accepted amendments that limited the power of the
police to confiscate printed material without prior court approval and the
power of state's attorneys to prosecute publishers, pressmen, journalists, and
distributors. In return for abolishing the stamp tax and publishers' bonds,
however, the parliament restored most of the offending clauses, which in any
case many national liberals favored as a check on socialist as well as on ultramontane agitation. In this form the bill was finally passed. 7°
Bismarck's need for consolidating legislation, his struggle against the Center and Polonism, his increasing concern over socialist agitation, and his
deepening quarrel with ultraconservatives had created a constellation of
forces in parliament potentially dangerous to the mixed constitutional order.
Yet the performance of the liberals in the spring of 1874 belied their strength
and certainly left him with no just cause for alarm. On the "Siamese twins"—
iron budget and press act—he got essentially what he wanted.

The Arnim Affair

the compromise he had just negotiated with the national liberals. Many free conservatives and
progovernment conservatives found the compromise a bitter pill. Moritz von Blanckenburg wrote

Junker, Arnim had entered the Prussian foreign service in 1851, the same year
as did Bismarck, with whom he was well acquainted. After serving as secretary
of legation in various posts, Arnim was appointed Prussian envoy to the Vatican in 1864 on Bismarck's recommendation. At the time Bismarck appears
to have thought highly of him. Arnim's performance in Rome raised some
questions about his ability to stay within his instructions; nevertheless, he
became Berlin's principal negotiator at the peace conferences with France at
Brussels and Frankfurt in 1871. After the treaty was signed, he was sent to
Paris as German ambassador, then the most important post in the German
foreign service. Here he soon outraged the chancellor by carrying on unauthorized, although not ineffective, negotiations with President Thiers over
the execution of the Frankfurt treaty. Acute disagreement developed between
the two men, moreover, over whether Berlin should favor a republic (Bismarck's position) or a Bourbon restoration (Arnim's position) in France. Yet
the eventual consequences of their dispute were out of proportion to the
cause. In February 1874 Arnim was recalled from Paris, then jailed, tried, and
convicted for misappropriating official documents. Ultimately he was also
convicted of treason and lese majesty.71
Arnim's principal offense never appeared in the indictments—that of competing with Bismarck for influence with the Kaiser and aspiring to replace him
as chancellor. Arnim was certainly not alone in speculating that Bismarck's
days were numbered, that either recurrent bad health or the death of the
Kaiser would soon end the chancellor's career.72 He was simply more foolish
and more vulnerable than others who engaged in the same sport. By bringing
his views on policy directly to the Kaiser, he threatened the prince's weakest
flank. Theoretically all German envoys were the personal representatives of
the Kaiser and as such had the right of direct access to him. Bismarck himself
had made use of this right during his years as Prussian minister in Frankfurt,
St. Petersburg, and Paris. Now he expected German diplomats to wheel and
turn at his command like troops on parade. To Arnim it seemed that the
chancellor wanted the reports of his ambassadors to reflect his own instructions rather than the actual situation.73 Bismarck was deeply annoyed by Arnim's persistence in advocating support for a monarchical restoration in
France and by his presumption in attempting, not without success, to influence the Kaiser. But he also suspected that Arnim had, on at least one occasion, delayed carrying out instructions to benefit his speculations on the stock
market, and he firmly believed that the ambassador was secretly opposing the
71

policy of his own government in the German and European press. Yet he was
compelled to undergo the humiliation of contending with this vain and presumptuous man for influence at the royal palace.74 The longer the humiliation, the greater the punishment. The chancellor bided his time, steadily
playing out the rope, while Arnim fashioned his own noose.
In May 1873 the Thiers government finally fell—to Bismarck's distress and
Arnim's delight—and was replaced by a promonarchist regime under Marshal
MacMahon. Bismarck suspected Arnim's complicity, for the ambassador had
often advocated intrigues to this end. Despite the ambassador's denials, he
persisted in insinuating this to Arnim, to the Kaiser, and in the public press.
In June 1873 he drafted a memorandum to Wilhelm, painting an exaggerated
picture of the consequences for Germany's domestic and foreign policy of Arnim's machinations at Paris and suggesting that the Kaiser, since he seemed
more impressed by Arnim's recommendations than by Bismarck's, find another minister to direct his foreign policy. But the document was never sent.75
Presumably the time was not yet ripe. On a visit to Berlin in early September,
Arnim spoke with both Wilhelm and Bismarck; the former, he said, was reassuring, the latter wrathful to the point of incoherence. Why, Arnim asked,
did Bismarck "persecute" him? "I," the prince replied, "am the persecuted.
For eight months—for a year—you have injured my health, robbed me of my
rest. You conspire with the empress [against me], and you will not rest until
you sit here at this desk, where I sit, and find out for yourself that this too is
not enough. I have known you since youth. You regard every superior as a
natural enemy; you said that yourself, years ago. I am the enemy at the moment. You delayed the conclusion of the convention of March 15 to bring
about the fall of Thiers, and I must bear the responsibility for this political
mistake. You have accused me before the Kaiser. You have connections at
court that have long hindered me from recalling you."76
The ease with which Bismarck finally obtained Arnim's recall belies the
seriousness of the threat he posed. Two days after that savage interview the
chancellor sent a dispatch to Paris protesting a pastoral letter of August 3,
1873, by the bishop of Nancy, who called upon the faithful in his diocese (to
which German Lorraine belonged) to pray for the reunion of Metz and Strassburg to France. Although the new French government went far in trying to
assuage him, Bismarck became steadily sharper in his rebukes and demands.
He was assisted in keeping the issue alive by the archbishop of Paris, who
issued a similar pastoral letter on September 9, and by an assembly of French
bishops at Bourges, which endorsed the pope's condemnation of the Kultur74

kampf. In substance the issue was nothing but a routine friction of the postwar
period, but Bismarck actually described it to the Kaiser on October n as a
grave crisis that threatened European peace. It may be that his purpose was
to point up the international ramifications of the Kulturkampf and perhaps
even to derive some benefit from it in the coming elections and in the debate
over the military budget that was to follow. At any rate he also repeatedly—
and untruthfully—charged that Arnim, who had returned to his post at the
end of September, was seriously derelict in pressing the German point of view
on the French government. By February 24, 1874, Wilhelm was sufficiently
impressed to order Arnim recalled from Paris.77
Except for Arnim's own folly, his recall would probably have ended the
affair. Stung by defeat and maltreatment, the ambassador secretly released to
a Viennese newspaper, Die Presse, documents written during his period in
Rome, purporting to show that he, in contrast to his government, had fore­
seen the consequences of the Vatican Council and the doctrine of infallibility
and implying that Bismarck, had he only heeded Arnim's advice, could have
avoided the Kulturkampf. In view of the widespread comment that followed
in the European press Bismarck published in the Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung other documents that tended to prove the contrary. This inspired Arnim
to defend himself in an open letter to Dollinger, which revealed still more
details about German policy toward the Catholic church. The German and
Austrian press began to choose sides as to who had shown the greater wisdom,
chancellor or ambassador.,8 The contest was hardly equal, for the chancellor
was the mechanic of German foreign policy, the ambassador its tool. For Bis­
marck to release official information to the press was legal and legitimate, for
Arnim to release it without authorization was illegal and insubordinate. Still
the case against Arnim might have resulted merely in reprimand and retire­
ment, 79 had not Friedrich von Holstein, secretary of legation at Paris, discov­
ered that eighty-six documents were missing from the embassy files.
Accused of theft, Arnim put up a lame defense: many of the missing papers
were private letters and had never been part of the embassy papers; others had
been taken by mistake and would be returned; some he did not have and had
never possessed. Meanwhile, Arnim sought to secure his political future by
purchasing a newspaper and campaigning for election to the Prussian House

τ> Arnim denied releasing the documents to Die Presse, and the case against him could not be
proved at the time, but it was established that he had launched a false report in a Belgian news­
paper in 1872 and, in denying responsibility for it, had made a false statement to the foreign
office. Kent, Arnim and Bismarck, pp. 137-139. On the legal proceedings against Arnim see

of Lords.80 On legal advice Bismarck recommended to the Kaiser that Arnim
be prosecuted on criminal charges—the only secure way to obtain speedy return of the missing papers. On October 4, 1874, Arnim was arrested at Nassenheide, his estate in Pomerania, on a warrant issued by the Berlin City
Court. An Austrian diplomat described the general reaction: "First impression: painful. Form of proceedings: shocking. Arrest unusual for this kind of
offence. It comes as a surprise that the city court here has been chosen. Antagonism [between Bismarck and Arnim] still too fresh in everybody's mind
not to interpret the trial as a personal affair."81 Correspondence seized at Nassenheide yielded interesting details on Arnim's relationship to journalists but
none of the missing documents. The preservation of official secrets was in any
case no longer the main purpose of the action. Backed by the Kaiser, Bismarck
was now bent on the total ruin of Harry von Arnim. He insisted on a public
trial.
By its verdict on December 19, 1874, the Berlin City Court proved its
professional competence and immunity to pressure from the government. The
judges cleared Arnim of several charges of misbehavior while in office, accepted his view that many of the documents taken were personal, but convicted him of purloining thirteen that were unquestionably official. Instead of
thirty months imprisonment demanded by the prosecutor, the court sentenced him to three. Both sides appealed the conviction, and in the Court of
Appeals the government had better luck—the sentence was increased to one
year (June 24, 1875). But Arnim was already out of reach. Released on bail
owing to his acute diabetes, he fled the country after his first conviction and
never returned. From Switzerland he petitioned the Kaiser, pleading less for
clemency than for "protection" against Bismarck's hatred. No sooner had the
petition arrived, however, than its effect was nullified. An anonymous pamphlet published in Switzerland appeared in Berlin bookstalls with the provocative title Pro Nihih: The Prelude to the Arnim Triai. The pamphlet, which the
Prussian police tried vainly to suppress, defended and glorified Arnim but vilified Bismarck, Wilhelm, and the courts. In addition, it disclosed information
on German relations with France since 1871. That Arnim was the author was
obvious and soon proven. In new proceedings before the Prussian Supreme
Court Arnim was convicted of treason and lese majesty (October 1876) and
sentenced to five years in prison. The hapless diplomat died in exile in 1881.82

he was delayed by illness and the death of a daughter. Judging from the publication in Die Presse,
he may have decided sometime during the two months after his recall to retire from the foreign
service and begin a political career.

Arnim was not without friends and defenders. Although he stemmed from
the lesser Pomeranian gentry, he had powerful connections. His first wife was
an illegitimate daughter of Prince August of Prussia, his second a daughter of
Count Adolf Heinrich von Arnim-Boitzenburg, once Prussian minister of interior, briefly minister-president in 1848, and thereafter leader of the conservatives in the House of Lords until his death in 1868. The count's son and
heir, Arnim's brother-in-law, was a free conservative deputy, who on December 8 (the day before Arnim's trial began in Berlin!) accepted appointment as
governor-general of Silesia, replacing a man regarded as too lenient in pursuing the Kulturkampf.83 This branch of the Arnim family was both numerous
and influential. Even Bismarck was distantly related to it through his sister's
marriage to Oskar von Arnim-Krochlendorff. Members of the Arnim clan
petitioned the Kaiser to pardon Harry, but Bismarck and Minister of Justice
Leonhardt pointed out that the sinner was impenitent, and the request was
refused.84
Among ultras Harry's prosecution was regarded as persecution, a vicious
attack by Bismarck upon a personal rival and yet another betrayal of his own
caste. After initial doubts liberal journalists and deputies were impressed by
the government's case against Arnim, but within the aristocratic opposition
his fate was regarded as another example of Bismarck's ruthlessness.85 Bismarck's motive in destroying Arnim was not entirely personal. The foreign
service of the German Reich was young, and its tradition still unformed despite its Prussian roots. One of Bismarck's intentions may have been to consolidate his authority over it by making an example of Arnim. Certainly Arnim possessed, despite some gifts, serious deficiencies as a diplomat. In
addition, he was vain, ambivalent, often contradictory, and sometimes mendacious. If his end was the consequence of his character, it was also revelatory
of Bismarck's. Arnim dug his own grave, but Bismarck armed him with pick
and shovel.

Kullmann and Majunke
During 1874-1875 the Kulturkampf mounted in intensity. Bismarck prodded
FaIk for new statutes authorizing punishment of contumacious bishops and the
dismissal of seminary directors, educators, and officials unwilling to conform
to the "new shape" of Prussian policy.86 In the spring of 1874 came a new
series of "May laws": a Reich "expatriation statute," authorizing the states to

expel refractory priests and deprive them of citizenship, and Prussian statutes
permitting the removal of church property and vacant benefices from the
control of contumacious bishops and strengthening state control over clerical
education.87 On January 14, 1874, the archbishop of Posen-Gnesen was imprisoned, on March 7 the bishop of Trier, on March 31 the archbishop of
Cologne, and on August 4 the bishop of Paderborn. Church officials who took
over their administrative functions were arrested, as were priests who refused
to leave parishes vacated by the courts; some were taken at the altar itself.
Among their parishioners tempers flared. On March 22 thousands packed the
square in front of Cologne cathedral to cheer the archbishop before his arrest.
Similar demonstrations were accorded the other bishops.88
OnJuIy 13, 1874, Eduard Kullmann, a twenty-one-year-old cooper's journeyman from Magdeburg, fired a pistol at Bismarck as the chancellor's carriage drove into the street outside his quarters at Bad Kissingen; at that moment Bismarck turned to greet someone, and the movement may have saved
his life. The bullet only creased his right hand. Kullmann was seized on the
spot and interrogated shortly afterward by his intended victim. He had acted,
the culprit declared, in anger over the May laws and Bismarck's treatment of
the Center party. That evening at a torchlight celebration of his escape the
chancellor said, "The blow aimed at me was directed not at me personally,
but at the cause for which I have dedicated my life: the unity, independence,
and freedom of Germany."89
Although belonging to a Catholic journeyman's association, Kullmann
acted alone; there was no evidence of conspiracy. Yet the official press depicted him as the natural fruit of priestly fanaticism,9" and Bismarck exploited
the episode by insisting that the Prussian government take sharper measures
against both Catholic and socialist agitators, including the closing of numerous Catholic associations and prosecution of newspapers.91 In early December
the Kullmann affair led to a rancorous scene in the Reichstag. During an
attack on Bismarck's foreign policy, the Bavarian centrist Edmund Jorg referred in passing to Kullmann's deed as the "crime of a half-crazy man." After
replying to Jorg's criticisms of his policies, Bismarck produced an uproar by
twice hurling at centrists sitting in front of him the charge: "Try to free yourselves from this murderer as you wish, he clings firmly to your coattails. He
calls you his party!" Amid the storm of applause and protest that raged
through the hall was heard a loud "Phooey!" from centrist deputy Count BaI87

lestrem. Bismarck reached for the pistol in his pocket, measured the distance,
and considered whether to aim at the stomach or between the eyes. But he
settled for a verbal bullet. "Phooey is an expression of loathing and scorn.
Don't think that such feelings are foreign to me; I am just too polite to express
them."92 The tumult that followed lasted for minutes, the deputies applauding, hissing, gesticulating. Lucius feared a fistfight would erupt. So did Forckenbeck, who was presiding, and sent for his hat. But the clamor finally subsided. "That evening," Lucius reported, "Bismarck was in a particularly good
mood, as after a satisfying action."»3
With Bismarck it is never easy to distinguish between tactic and belief,
calculation and sentiment. Certainly he exploited Kullmann's deed to win
public sympathy, as he had that of Ferdinand Cohen-Blind in 1866.94 To the
same end he kept the courts busy during 18 74-18 75 trying cases of libel and
slander. The cases were so numerous that Arthur von Brauer, the official
charged with initiating these cases, drafted a standard form that could be
quickly filled out and dispatched to the prosecutor's office. No offender who
came to Bismarck's attention, not even the lowliest, escaped. Brauer could
remember only one case that was not processed, that of a drunken Catholic
reported to have said, "Bismarck can kiss my arse." The report came back
from the chancellor's desk with a reply: "He mine also!" Again personal and
political motives were mixed. Bismarck wanted to show the country how
shamelessly its greatest statesman was being abused, but also to cripple the
ultramontane and socialist newspapers with fines.95
By this time threatening letters were common in Bismarck's mail, and he
felt his life was in constant danger. No more did he sally forth from his quarters in the Wilhelmstrasse without an armed guard. The pistols of his two
would-be assassins fascinated him. Blind's had been purchased by Delbriick
and given to the chancellor as a present; Kullmann's was purchased by Bismarck himself from the Bavarian state's attorney. The two weapons lay on his
desk, and he often regaled vistors with detailed accounts of both episodes.
They were not, however, mere souvenirs. In December 1874 a guest at a parliamentary soiree picked up Blind's pistol for a closer look, and the weapon
discharged.96 The prince, it appears, no longer knew what to expect of people

who entered his office. His reaction to Ballestrem's "Phooey!" shows what
was on his mind. His next assailant would receive a bullet from the pistol of
the first.
Evidently Bismarck genuinely believed that ultramontanes were guilty of
having spurred Kullmann to his deed. Otherwise he would not have reacted
so strongly, a few days after the altercation with Jorg, to the Reichstag's action
in the Majunke affair. Paul Majunke was a priest, parliamentary deputy, and
editor of Germania, which had become the chief voice of the ultramontanes.
In the latter capacity he had been sentenced to a year's imprisonment for
slandering the Kaiser, Bismarck, and other ministers, but evaded jail by going
abroad. When the Reichstag session began, he took advantage of his presumed immunity as a parliamentary deputy and returned. On December 11,
1874, he was arrested by the Berlin police on orders from the same city court
that was trying Harry von Arnim. Next day Lasker brought the matter to the
attention of the Reichstag, which voted without debate or dissent to refer the
case to its rules committee for quick investigation. In the committee there
was doubt whether the wording of the constitution actually foreclosed an arrest on a conviction that had preceded the opening of the session. But it was
also evident that many national liberals had begun to have second thoughts
about the issue. On December 16, the committee reported itself unable to
make a recommendation. By a narrow vote, 158 to 151, the chamber rejected
a motion to table and then approved Hoverbeck's motion for a constitutional
amendment that would "preserve the dignity of the Reichstag" by making
impossible the arrest of a deputy during the session without its permission.
Lasker's group joined progressives and centrists to form the majority.97
Bismarck's reaction to these events was astounding. On December 13,
1874, Lucius reported him "extremely indignant" over the vote to refer the
Majunke case to committee. By its "tactless" failure to ascertain beforehand
the government's position, the Reichstag "has confirmed my conviction that
one cannot govern with such parliamentary bodies and my intention to withdraw from all [governmental] affairs in my sixtieth year. Lasker is not happy
unless he can execute a freedom caper against the government."98 On Decemstatesman Francesco Cnspi was startled to note "a small pistol with a white grip on the table."

anger over the Majunke episode and the Hoverbeck motion. According to one source, the chancellor had made an effort at rapprochement with the progressives during 1874 in the hope of
building a new base of support in both liberal parties against the Center and conservatives. If so,
it came to an abrupt end. Parisius, Parteien, p. 200; BP, I, 85-87.

ber 16, Bennigsen found the chancellor "in a frightful turmoil, such as I have
never seen before. He said repeatedly that he must resign, that he could not
put up any longer with the annoyances at court and with an uncertain Reichs­
tag majority. Ί have already been shot at twice. Daily I receive warnings from
the police not to go walking any more or to travel in an open carriage. Now
let another chancellor be shot at by fanaticized Catholic workmen.' " Bis­
marck's wife and daughter, Bennigsen concluded, were exciting him more and
more with their cares and anxieties. Princess Bismarck, with whom the dep­
uty had a long talk, "seriously believes there is a great ultramontane murder
conspiracy, which could order new attempts at assassination at any time." 9 9
Next day the deputy Frankenberg recorded in his diary: "This morning the
news spread like wild fire: Bismarck has handed in his resignation. The
Reichstag looked like a disturbed beehive." 100
At a parliamentary dinner held on December 17 in the chancellor's quar­
ters, Bismarck spoke to deputies Bennigsen, Miquel, Wehrenpfennig, and
Lowe about "the grave occurrence in the Reichstag." He would resign, he was
quoted as saying, because the previous day's vote had shown that he no longer
had a majority in the Reichstag. "The National Liberal party lacks a firm
leadership and has no recognized leader. Bennigsen would be incomparably
preferable in that capacity to Lasker, whom the prince holds for a good sol­
dier, but a bad general. He demanded that the majority seek contact with him
and that he be able to depend upon it with greater certainty than previously."
In voting for the Hoverbeck resolution, Lasker and forty members of the Na­
tional Liberal party had sided with his "most extreme opponents, the Center
party." The deputies tried to assuage him, pointing out that the issue was the
Reichstag's internal affair, that the chancellor was in no way bound by the
Hoverbeck resolution, and that in any case the matter was not of an "urgent
nature." But Bismarck continued to insist that his request to step down was a
fait accompli. Since there was no likelihood that the Kaiser would let Bis­
marck go, the deputies left the Wilhelmstrasse knowing that they must either
appease "sulking Achilles" or face a dissolution and reelection of the Reichs­
tag. 101
Unwittingly Ludwig Windthorst provided them with a solution. Undis­
puted leader of the Center party since Mallinckrodt's death in May, Wind­
thorst was on the alert for issues that, like the Hoverbeck resolution, might
spark another oppositional majority. On December 18, he moved that the
foreign office's "disposition fund" be abolished. Like the notorious "Guelph
fund," this appropriation was secretly dispensed by the chancellor to influence
the press (Windthorst spoke of "the general purchase of public opinion"). In
the past it had often been the target of liberal criticism. But this time the

centrist leader blundered, for Bennigsen seized the chance to deliver a rousing
defense of Bismarck's achievements in foreign affairs. He treated the chancellor's "extreme irritability" not as a personal weakness, but as a natural consequence of malicious attacks upon him by those seeking to undermine the
"institutions of the German Reich and German national policy." He converted the retention of the disposition fund into a general vote of confidence
in Bismarck's leadership. Windthorst's motion was overwhelmed, 199 to 71,
the minority being composed of centrists, Poles, socialists, and one maverick
democrat. Apprised of the result, Bismarck, resplendent in full uniform,
strode into the chamber, mounted the dais, and grasped the speaker, Forckenbeck, by the hand. The chamber erupted in "stormy applause."102

Windthorst and Lasker
There was no rational motive for Bismarck's violent reaction to the Reichstag's conduct in the Majunke affair. The unanimity of the decision to refer
the matter to committee shows that the action was procedural, not substantive. The Hoverbeck resolution had no binding effect on the government;
without Bismarck's consent no constitutional amendment could have passed
the Bundesrat. Whether even the Reichstag would have passed it was dubious.I03 Nor was there any evident reason why at the time a parliamentary
crisis would have been useful to Bismarck. In recent years the Reichstag and
Prussian Chamber of Deputies had, with some compromises, passed the statutes he considered vital. Majorities had been found for the Kulturkampf laws,
iron budget, and press act. By initiating a statute creating an imperial bank,
the Reichstag had contributed significantly to Bismarck's program for the consolidation of the Reich. Progress was being made in drafting imperial law
codes that would further the same purpose. Barring a dissolution, the next
parliamentary election was two years distant. On December n - 1 4 , 1874—
that is, during the days when the Majunke affair boiled over—the Reichstag
deliberated on military appropriations in the annual budget. On the Reichstag's insistence the appropriation was discussed for the first time by item rather
than as a lump sum (Pauschquantum); yet the debate went smoothly, and even
the Kaiser was satisfied with the result.104 At dinner on December 13 Bismarck himself said repeatedly, "Everything has been going well." "Then sud··" SBR (1874-1875), II, 806-812; Oncken, Bennigsen, II, 275-278.

In Jan. 1875, the progressives introduced a constitutional amendment to eliminate the
loophole that had permitted Majunke's arrest. But the bill did not reach the floor of the chamber

denly," he continued, "a sharp wind blows out of a side alley and upsets ev­
erything." 105
Bismarck's conduct in the Majunke affair shows how subject German poli­
tics had become to his physical and mental health. The letters of his wife to
their eldest son, then on the staff of the Prussian legation in Munich, provide
an intimate account of the fluctuations in his health during the critical winter
of 1874-1875. During the autumn months at Varzin she reported his condi­
tion as "fairly good," but complained repeatedly of a "terrible, never-ending
cough." 106 At Berlin in late November the weather turned frigid. "It's freezing
here, stone and bone, as they say" and Papachen caught cold, producing ab­
dominal pains "as earlier in Varzin." After a Reichstag speech on December
ι, his condition worsened—acute stomach disorder "accompanied by severe
and unceasing heartburn." What physicians prescribed seemed merely to
worsen his condition. Buoyed perhaps by his fierce response to the ultramon­
tane attack (Jorg) on his foreign policy on December 4, he was "much better"
for a few days,I07 but the improvement did not last. During the rest of Decem­
ber and into January 1875, Johanna reported, her husband suffered "difficult
nights—just a few hours sleep in the morning, not enough to rid him of fa­
tigue, which remains in his limbs the entire day. No desire to eat whatever,
absolutely no interest in wine, and frequent heartburn as before. All of this
distresses and upsets me very much and, in addition, hate letters and news­
paper clippings constantly arrive threatening my beloved's life."108 The hand
wounded by Kullmann continued to ache, a constant reminder of danger.IOQ
From the physician Struck, Lucius heard, "The princess influences him also
with her fears of assassination and makes him anxious." 110 "For weeks he has
suffered from insomnia," Johanna confided to Tiedemann. "He can't sleep
because he gets so angry, and then he gets very angry because he can't
sleep."111
"Anger and hate are bad counselors in politics, and I pray to God for hu­
mility and forgiveness," Bismarck had written to the Kaiser, shortly after KuIlmann's attack. I I 2 Yet the anger welled up in him and affected both his health

Bismarck household at dinner on January 25, 1875, Christoph von Tiedemann has unwittingly given us vital clues to the interaction between anger,
insomnia, appetite, and physical health as they affected Bismarck's psychic
state and personal conduct at this critical time in his life. As mentioned earlier,113 Bismarck astounded Tiedemann by complaining that he lacked appetite, then proceeding to consume two portions of every course, including

pickled boar's head (over Johanna's protests), chased by long draughts of beer
from a large silver tankard. On that occasion he had two men on his mind:
Windthorst and Lasker. A philosophical discussion about Schopenhauer, Eduard von Hartmann, and Goethe came around with seeming inevitability to
what was uppermost in his thoughts: "And Goethe has been almost always
loved, seldom hated. Yet hate is as great a spur to life as love. Two things
preserve and embellish my life: my wife and—Windthorst. The one is there
for love, the other for hate." Later that evening he went through the catechism of his dislikes: those "feminine influences" that complicated the KuIturkampf; the "many privy counselors in the ministries" who were "warm
friends of the ultramontanes"; those "quite cracked conservatives" who were
"blind with hatred against everything that is called liberal"; and "part of the
national liberals with whom nothing can be accomplished. Their doctrines
work like blinders, and it is a pity that a man like Lasker can play such a role.
Lasker is the real disease that infects the state; he is even more of a diseasebearing louse than Windthorst."114
Bismarck's rage at Windthorst reveals the degree of his frustration over his
failure to overcome the resistance of the Center either by browbeating the
Catholic hierarchy or by appealing to the nationalistic and patriotic instincts
of Catholic voters. But it also shows the rising personal cost of the struggle.
The alienation of old friends and their cries of betrayal tore at his nerves and
upset his psychic balance. Their apostasy made him more dependent upon
liberal allies who, although hardly a serious threat, were basically distasteful
to him. In particular, it galled him that this "dumb Jew boy" Lasker had been
elevated by an election that was the product of the Kulturkampf into a potentially commanding position in the Reichstag."5 The mere fact that Lasker
appeared to have that possibility of alternate choice, Bismarck's own favorite
position in politics, disturbed the prince, even though the record of the preceding year did not justify the assumption that the deputy either would or
could exploit it to become a serious threat. With jaundiced eye the prince
watched every action in the chamber that seemed to indicate that Lasker's
influence was growing. Hence he blew the Majunke affair up into a major
crisis in his relationship with parliament. His emotions got the better of his
political judgment.

High Point of the Kulturkampf
If not responsible for details of the May laws of 1873-1874, Bismarck was
unquestionably the driving force behind the more drastic legislation of 1875.
"For me," he said, "the first consideration of the moment is to fight ultramon1,4

tanism; everything else is secondary."1'6 Increasingly he was dissatisfied with
the efforts of his colleagues and subordinates. "FaIk believes he can fight ultramontanes with velvet gloves, but iron claws are appropriate." "FaIk is a
captious lawyer; he doesn't go for the whole, but only pulls single gray hairs
out of the black pelt." "FaIk proceeds too slowly and timidly; we must clear
the road; that is, we want now to bring the matter to the point of bending or
breaking."117 "Daily I have to complain about the conduct of my colleagues.
All too often they act as though the task were entirely that of solving legal
problems. . . . The minister of interior [Eulenburg] does not generally proceed with the desirable energy."118 He urged upon his colleagues "a purification of officialdom" in the Catholic provinces. The bureaucratic "organs" of
state must be staffed with men capable of pursuing with independent zeal and
initiative the policy of the state against "the hostile influence of the clergy."
The state must employ "every legal means within its power to break resistance
to the authority of the law." To do anything less was to underestimate the
severity of the struggle and responsibility of the government. What new laws,
he wondered, would be "necessary to break the influence of the priests?"119
What vexed Bismarck about the May laws was not their severity, but their
failure to deploy the power of the state adequately to demoralize the foe.
While keeping prosecutors and courts busy, they merely irritated Catholic
clergy and laymen into greater resistance.
During 1875 the actions of the papacy and the Prussian bishops provided
him with provocation for further action. On February 5 Pius IX issued an
encyclical that boldly declared Prussia's May laws "invalid, since they contravene completely the divine dispositions of the church." The bishops were
admonished to stand fast against the state's incursions. "As it is written, one
must obey God more than men."I2° The answer of the Prussian government
was the so-called "suspension and breadbasket act" (Spen- una Brotkorbge'
set?:). Enacted into law on April 22, 1875, the statute suspended most of the
state's annual subsidy (889,718 out of 1,011,745 thalers) to the Catholic
church. In the hope of dividing the clergy, it provided that bishops who obligated themselves in writing to obey Kulturkampf laws would have their allocations restored.I21 In reply, Prussia's bishops petitioned the king and House

(June 18, 1875) abolishing three articles in the constitution: article 15, which
granted to the Evangelical, Catholic, and other churches the right of autonomous administration; article 16, which granted to the Catholic church the
right to communicate with Rome; and article 18, which abolished the power
of the state to nominate, elect, and confirm candidates for church offices.123
Another statute of June 20, 1875, removed church property from the bishop's
administration and placed it under a committee elected by the congregation.
The capstone of all Kulturkampf legislation was laid in early May with the
passage of the "congregations statute," ordering the dissolution within six
months of all cloisters not engaged in healing or teaching.I24
In whipping these statutes through the Prussian cabinet and Landtag, Bismarck encountered his greatest problem not from legislators, but from his king
and colleagues. For three years he had advocated excision of the three offending articles in the constitution. Before there could be peace, he told Hohen•" SBHH (1875), I, 409, 657.

in the Hohenzollem monarchy provided medical and educational services that the state could
not readily replace. Only 189 houses were closed during the two years that followed passage of

lohe, Prussian law had to be "purged" of all those elements that "since the
time of Friedrich Wilhelm IV have confused the relationship between church
and state."125 But the ministers resisted his drastic step, which affected the
Protestant as well as Catholic church. To break their resistance, Bismarck had
to deploy his ultimate weapon—the threat of resignation. Properly interpreted, this was actually a threat to get the Kaiser to dismiss the other ministers by forcing the ruler to choose between them and Bismarck. When it came
to dissolution of the cloisters, Wilhelm was the greatest obstacle. Visiting in
Wiesbaden, the monarch was temporarily out of Bismarck's reach, but well
within range of Empress Augusta, who was sympathetic to the Catholic cause.
Wilhelm insisted that the law exclude nursing orders and allow teaching orders four years to dissolve. For once Bismarck let him have his way.12<s
Neither house of the Landtag presented much difficulty. In the Chamber
of Deputies the Center party and its Polish and Guelph allies fought practically alone against these draconian laws. Progressives and national liberals
vied with one another in baiting ultramontane deputies, particularly Windthorst, who sought to define the issue as one of religious liberty. Among liberals voting en masse for amendments to the constitution were, ironically,
some who in 1848-1850 had striven mightily for inclusion and retention of
clauses guaranteeing freedom of thought, expression, and religion. Bismarck,
who actively defended most of the bills in both houses of the legislature,
clashed sharply with old friends—Ludwig von Gerlach, now allied with centrists in the Chamber of Deputies, and Hans von Kleist-Retzow, leader of the
ultras in the House of Lords. Gerlach interpreted the Spengesetz as a declaration of war against one-third of Prussia's population and an affirmation of the
deified state; the state is God, and the Kultusminister is his prophet. But Bismarck denied any belief in the "heathen Godhead of state" and reaffirmed his
faith in the trinity: "God, King, and Country." Gerlach was isolated among
conservative deputies, all of whom voted for this and the other laws.I27 Even
in the House of Lords the resistance was less than expected, for some "feudalists" who had voted against the May laws were unable to countenance the
pope's attempted "invalidation" of Prussian statutes. In balloting on the
Spengesetz on April 15, 1875, thirty peers followed Kleist-Retzow in opposing
the bill, which passed with a majority of 91. Bismarck praised the majority for
building "a bridge with which to reunite" the Conservative party, whose division had caused him "great injury." But the bridge was shaky. One hundred
and fifteen unexcused peers did not vote. The cloister bill and constitutional
amendments passed by an even smaller vote, 66 to 24 and 69 to 24. The

number of abstentions was ominous—114 on the first vote, 103 on the second. " 8
Although the Kulturkampf's origin must be sought in Bismarck's genuine
anxiety about the advance of Polonism in eastern Prussia and about the dangers of political Catholicism for Germany's foreign relations and internal consolidation, he sought to exploit it to build up a reliable parliamentary majority. During the debate on the Sperrgesetz in the lower chamber, he spoke of
the Kulturkampf as "an extraordinarily useful school" for statesmen. The deputies were learning that the state must be strengthened against subversive
parties. "The consequence of this will be that with time we shall have only
two parties—one that negates the state and fights it, the other composed of
patriotic, loyally inclined, respectable people. . . . This great party will take
shape, and it will ultimately embrace all parties that want the state at all.
These parties are now already coming closer together." Those on the extreme
right, he continued, had become "more open, more modern"; those on the
left, to "recognize the indispensability of the state." "All the earlier sins in
political life have given way to repentance and conversion . . . and the patriotic majority has become larger and stronger."129
During the Kulturkampf it was an open question as to who was making the
greater gains: Bismarck or his liberal allies. Thinking that they had the better
part of the bargain, liberals of both parties were increasingly reluctant to challenge the government on any important issue of power. They watched Bismarck, Wilhelm, and most conservatives march down the broadening path
of modernization in economic and cultural life and were only too happy to
bulldoze away the obstacles. For Bismarck the Kulturkampf became, among
other things, a tool for political consolidation. Through it he hoped to weld
together a large and subservient parliamentary majority that could be used on
other political fronts. By pointing to a common foe, he hoped to give liberals
and conservatives, bourgeois and aristocrats a common cause. In the spring
of 1875 this tactic appeared to have achieved some success.130 Whether it
would suffice to hold the majority together on major issues unrelated to the
Kulturkampf remained to be seen.

This tactic does not suffice to explain either the origins of the Kulturkampf in Bismarck's
thought and action or the actual course of German politics in the 1870s and 1880s. It was the
expedient by-product of a struggle begun for other purposes, another demonstration of his capacity to perceive and strike at more than one target in any developing political action. See the

Reconstruction in Foreign Relations
N RECENT works historians have tended to see in almost every facet
of Bismarck's diplomacy, including the wars of unification, evidence
that the chancellor was motivated by the "primacy of domestic pol­
icy" (Prirruxt der InnenpoUtik). According to this view, his foreign no
less than his domestic policy aimed at consolidating the power of the German
"ruling classes"—that is, the agrarian, industrial, and financial elites—against
the social and political ambitions of lesser interest groups and social classes.
Foreign policy was harnessed to a number of defensive strategies whose pur­
pose was to buttress the Prussian-German establishment against social and
political democratization in an age of industrialization and modernization.'
This interpretation does not suffice in itself to explain German foreign policy
before or after 1871. Seldom is hard evidence to be found that economic or
social strategies were primary in determining Bismarck's course in foreign af­
fairs. We shall see that on significant occasions the predominant evidence
points rather to the contrary. "Foreign policy and economic affairs must never
be combined with one another," he declared in the 1890s. "Each is balanced
within itself. If one of them is burdened by the other, the equilibrium is lost."2
The high-level diplomatic correspondence of the great nations in the nine­
teenth and early twentieth centuries contains few references to the require­
ments of foreign trade, foreign investment, pressure from special interests,
and the need to seek abroad the safety valve for domestic discontents. Instead
the dispatches are full of reports and speculation on the attitudes of rulers and
foreign ministers, changing alignments and realignments among states, alter' See Helmut Bohme, Deutschlands Weg zur Grossmacht: Studien zum Veriuiltnis von Wirtschaft

nating fears of isolation and entanglement, shifts in the balance of power
engendered by those fears, and the changed margins of safety and danger
those shifts produce. These concerns are not phantasmagoria, but real dangers
that can affect not only the future of governments, but also the security and
welfare of millions. No less than party politics in a parliamentary system,
politics among states reflects a struggle for power that can transcend the demands of material interest and ideological commitment. Within such systems
the competing units tend to become functions of one another; the most irreconcilable interests are compelled to take each other into account in their
search for security or aggrandizement. The mastery of these dynamic, everfluctuating relationships is the task of statecraft. Never was any statesman
more conscious than Bismarck of this task and the requirements it imposes.
His first aim after the victory of 1870-1871 was to escape the isolation that
was the predictable cost of a unilateral disruption of the balance of power
system.

Limits of the German Nation
Nowhere was apprehension concerning Bismarck's further intentions after the
victory over France more acute than in Great Britain. Suspicion of Napoleon
III and belief in the justice of the German desire for national unity had prejudiced British opinion in favor of Germany at the beginning of the war, but
this mood quickly evaporated after the battle of Sedan. Now the realization
dawned that the eclipse of France meant the supremacy of Germany. In parliament Benjamin Disraeli, leader of the opposition, depicted in dire terms
the consequences of what the Gladstone government had presumably permitted to happen. "This war represents the German revolution, a greater political event than the French revolution. I don't say a greater, or as great a social
event. What its social consequences may be are in the future. Not a single
principle in the management of our foreign affairs, accepted by all statesmen
for guidance up to six months ago, any longer exists. There is not a diplomatic
tradition that has not been swept away. You have a new world, new influences
at work, new and unknown objects and dangers with which to cope. . . . The
balance of power has been entirely destroyed, and the country that suffers
most, and feels the effects of this great change most, is England."3 The Germanophile Sir Robert Morier rejoiced "at this great turning-point" in the history of Europe as well as Germany. Yet he too feared that "unparalleled successes" and the "absolute power that the German nation has acquired over
Europe" would tend "to modify the German national character, and not necessarily for the better. Arrogance and overbearingness are the qualities likely
to be developed in a Teutonic race under such conditions, not boasting or

vaingloriousness."4 The German demand for Alsace-Lorraine also aroused
forebodings. Gladstone himself anticipated that "this violent laceration and
transfer" would be "the beginning of a new series of European complications."5
Odo Russell, British ambassador in Berlin after 1871, believed that the chancellor's objective was "the supremacy of Germany in Europe and of the German race in the world" and that he would "go any lengths" to achieve this
end. The annexation appeared to be a step toward the unification of Germanspeaking Europe under the government in Berlin.6
Statesmen in southern Germany and Austria suspected even before 1870
that Bismarck had such a goal. For Count Friedrich von Beust, the AustroHungarian chancellor, the greatest danger in the union of northern and
southern Germany lay not in the growth of Prussian power, undesirable as
that was, but in the attraction that a unified Germany would have for the
German population of the Habsburg Empire. He was convinced that Prussia,
if she gained control over the south, would not halt at the Austrian border,
but would inevitably seek to found a great-German empire stretching all the
way to the Adriatic Sea.7 In July 1870 the Austro-Hungarian Minister of War
Baron Franz Kuhn von Kuhnenfeld expressed the fears of the war party in
Vienna when he wrote, "If Prussia is victorious and we remain neutral, it will
be a certainty that the Prussian king, proclaimed Kaiser of Germany immediately after the great victory, will declare that all German kings have lost
their thrones and will unite the great German Reich under the scepter of the
Hohenzollern. The Prussian spiked helmet will stand on the River Inn and it
would perhaps be only a question of time how long the German provinces of
Austria would remain under Austrian rule. Prussians on the Inn means Finis
Austriae. The rule of the Hohenzollern would then stretch from the North
Sea to the Adriatic over sixty million Germans. . . . Hungary alone would
remain as a refuge state for the house of Habsburg, for powerful Germany will
not suffer the German river, the Danube, to remain in alien hands. Germany
will incorporate the whole stream to the Rumanian border and destroy the
empire of the Magyars."8

exploit against Prussia the latent fears in St. Petersburg that Russia too would
be affected by the movement for a German national state. On being posted
as ambassador to Russia in October 1869, Count Emile Fleury was instructed
to warn the Russian chancellor, Prince Alexander Gorchakov, that the "Germanic idea" would be a danger to Europe; if it continued to grow, the concept
would "naturally encompass within its sphere of action all populations that
speak German—from Courland to Alsace."9 InJuIy 1871 Jules Favre, foreign
minister of the Thiers regime, instructed the new ambassador to Russia, General Le Flo, to point out to the Russians that the "principle of German unity"
invoked by Prussia to justify her territorial aggrandizement must inevitably
lead to the attempt to acquire "all peoples of German origin" on the Danube
and likewise the "German provinces of Russia."10
From 1866, when the issue first arose, until the end of his life Bismarck
consistently maintained that Berlin could not afford to display any official
interest in the fate of either the German population in the Habsburg Empire
or the German diaspora in Russia and the new world. Although "every German" regarded with sympathy the efforts of the Germans in Russia to preserve
"their nationality and especially their language," he declared in 1870, any
public display of that sympathy would be a disservice to the victims. It would
merely arouse hopes for German assistance that were illusory, for "no real
political interest" of Germany was involved. An attempt at intervention
would merely confirm Russian suspicions that Germany had designs on the
Baltic provinces. The tsarist Russification program would be intensified and
German relations with Russia injured.11 In July 1870 Hans Lothar von
Schweinitz, north German envoy to Vienna, reported widespread apprehension on the Danube that Prussia, if victorious over France, would "devour"
the German, and Russia the Slavic regions of the Habsburg Empire. Bismarck
replied, "The suspicion that northern Germany could have the inclination or
interest to destroy the Austrian monarchy is an absurdity that I have often
exposed. The incorporation of so-called German Austria with its Czech and
Slovenes in the North German Confederation would mean the destruction of
the latter." No one, he continued, could visualize Vienna as a provincial city
lying on the frontier of a German Reich. Statesmen on both sides of the Leitha must surely grasp that he regarded "every tendency toward German conquest of Austria is a folly that is outside national politics."12
Foreign diplomats who expected Bismarck to launch a pan-German policy
were inaccurate not only in their judgment of his intentions, but also in their
assessment of German public opinion and what influence it might have on
foreign policy. The lively debate within the German intelligentsia between
the advocates of a small-German (ldeindeutsch) and great-German {gross* Les origines diplomaaques de Xa guerre de 1870/71 (Paris, 1910-1932), XXV, p. 377 (fh.).

deutsch) unification had long since been resolved in favor of the former. The
narrow victory of the small-Germanists in the Frankfurt parliament in 18481849, their success in capturing the academic community and the public press
in the 1850s and 1860s through the activities of the Nationalverein, and the
deepening economic cleavage between Austria and the Zollverein produced
by Germany's rapid industrialization in the same period had all prepared the
way for popular acceptance in 1866-1871 of the frontiers that Bismarck established. In common speech after 1871 "Germany" was no longer the land of
Arndt ("soweit die deutsche Zunge klingt"), but that of Bismarck and the lcieindeutsch movement. After the dissolution of the German confederation "Germany" and "Austria" identified two separate states, regions, and peoples.
The progressive contraction in the meaning of the term "Germany" can be
traced in public documents. In the treaty of Nikolsburg in 1866 Kaiser Franz
Joseph consented to "a reconstruction of Germany without participation of
the Austrian imperial state." Amendments introduced into the German constitution in 1870-1871 anchored this narrower conception of the nation in
the basic law of the Reich. The terms "German" and "German Reich" were
substituted for "north German" and "North German Confederation." The
preamble and first article defined the region of the German Reich by listing
its member states, and Bismarck insisted on the title "Deutscher Kaiser"
rather than "Kaiser von Deutschland." And yet later clauses identified the
German Reich as "Germany." Particularly significant was article 3, which
read, "For entire Germany there exists a common citizenship [Indigenat].
. . ." A Bundesrat committee charged with a final review of the amended
constitution declared the expression "Germany" to be inaccurate, "for the
German Reich obviously embraces regions inhabited by a population of nonGerman nationality, while other large regions exist next to and independent
of the German Reich that are inhabited by genuinely German peoples [Volksstdmme]." Yet the committee majority could not "bring itself (in the words
of the Baden minister Rudolf von Freydorf) to advise against using the term
"Germany" in the constitution of a Reich that included most of Germanspeaking Europe.I3
The expressions of the constitution were those used within the Reichstag
and Bundesrat, the public press, and (one may assume) popular speech. The
general public (except for ethnic minorities) quickly came to think of the
German Reich as the "German national state." The word Stamm remained to
identify subdivisions of the nation distinguished by territory, dialect and (according to tradition) tribal origin. This transformation occurred with surprising speed. In November 1871 a Bavarian particularist provoked derisive
laughter in the Reichstag when he described the "German Reich" as com13

251

posed of "nations" possessing "special characteristics" to be respected and preserved. I4 To liberal-national deputies at least it was now ludicrous to apply
the word "nation" to anything but the Jdeindeutsch Reich. Advocates of the
"return" of Alsace-Lorraine did not necessarily look upon the German-speaking regions of Switzerland, Austria, Bohemia, and the Baltic as irredenta that
must one day be recovered. On the contrary, Heinrich von Treitschke was
vigorously applauded when he told the Reichstag in November 1871: "I believe that whoever works for the fall of Austria out of a fantastic sentimentality for our fellow Germans there acts, knowingly or unknowingly, as an enemy
of the German Reich."15 In later years German nationalists were sympathetic
toward the struggle of Austrian Germans to maintain their traditional dominance within the Habsburg Empire, but few believed that the future of the
"German nation" was involved in the outcome. Only socialists argued that
separation from Austria was a tragic loss to the German people. Among Catholics there was considerable division and ambivalence. The views of some
were indistinguishable from those of liberal nationalists, while others accepted, if regretfully, the irreversibility of the events of 1866-1871. Only a
shrinking minority of "Reich Germans" appears to have deplored the contraction in the public mind concerning what constituted "Germany." The
anguished reaction of the few who protested is itself proof that the contraction
occurred. One who protested was Paul de Lagarde, who lamented that 45
million Reich Germans had tragically "forgotten" Austria-Hungary's 10 million Germans. l6 To the Austrian poet Franz Grillparzer it was an occasion for
rhyme:17
Ais Deutscher ward ich geboren
Bin ich noch einer?
Nur, was ich Deutsches geschrieben,
Das nimmt mix keiner.
Not until the emergence of "pan-Germanism" in the 1880s did the popular
concept of the "German nation" begin to expand again from the region of the
Reich to the region of German-speaking Europe. We shall see that Bismarck

The Dynamics of Foreign Policy

On the evening of August 13, 1871, Bismarck granted a two-hour interview
to the French charge d'affaires in Berlin, in which he stated with brutal frankness what he expected from France. "The state of [public] opinion, the attitude of the press, and the language of the French government, which does
not seem to favor good relations between our two countries, seem to indicate
that you would like soon to have your revenge." France would pay 2 billion
of its indemnity of 5 billion francs, he predicted, but would make war in 1874
rather than pay the rest. To fight "sooner rather than later" was best for Germany; to return to the battlefields in less than ten years would be "suicidal"
for France. "But that is your affair."'8
The French diplomat thought the chancellor had "exaggerated"; yet this
was not the case. From the moment war was declared in July 1870, Bismarck
firmly believed that France would never be reconciled to the loss of her position as the foremost power on the European continent. Whether history
would have proved him right we cannot know, for the annexation of AlsaceLorraine made his prophecy self-fulfilling. In order to gain a secure military
barrier to the west he inflicted upon France an injury that no future French
party or government could accept as permanent.
The enduring hostility of France seriously reduced the flexibility of the
strategy of alternatives that Bismarck had employed with such devastating
effect in the preceding decade. It was no longer possible to "hold open every
door and every turning."19 One door appeared to be permanently closed. But
other factors also forced him to readjust his political tactics after 1871. During
the preceding years he had exploited with great effect the fluid situation in
European politics produced by the Crimean War and the upsurge of nationalism produced by the war of 1859 and its aftermath in Italy. The breach
between Austria and Russia after 1855 and the fears generated by Napoleon's
ambitious and blundering foreign policy after 1861 had opened the gates
through which Prussia had passed. The growth of national sentiment had provided him with a moral justification for Prussia's expansion that made it palatable to German and European public opinion.
But now Germany, being a satiated state, needed time to digest what it had
devoured. The task of German foreign policy was to shield the Reich from
external danger during a period of internal consolidation. The moment had
arrived to switch from a revolutionary to a conservative foreign policy. In
Bismarck's opinion Germany no longer had any objective that could profitably be attained by war. In fact, any European military conflict involving two
major powers was contrary to German interests. Whatever the origin, whoever the combatants, wherever the battlefield, Germany was likely to become

involved. In such a war she would inevitably be trapped into fighting for
someone else's interests. RealpoUtik dictated that Germany strive to preserve
the peace of Europe.
The dominant position achieved by Germany in European politics as a result of the victories over Austria and France and widespread suspicion of Bismarck's plans for exploiting it ought to have generated new alliances designed
to redress the balance by holding Germany within its new frontiers. In his
famous "Kissingen dictation," composed June 15, 1877, in the middle of the
great Balkan crisis that led to the Congress of Berlin, Bismarck stated succinctly what bothered him, not only at that time, but also throughout the last
two decades of his chancellorship. "A French newspaper recently said of me
that I am afflicted by 'Ie cauchemar des coalitions'; this kind of incubus will
remain a justified concern to German ministers for a long time, perhaps forever. A coalition can be formed against us by west European powers with the
addition of Austria; more dangerous still would be one composed of RussiaAustria-France. A great intimacy between two of the last named powers
would provide the third at any time with the means of putting us under very
painful pressure. . . . If able to work, I could develop and complete the picture that I visualize: not that of any territorial acquisition, but of a total political situation, in which all powers, except France, need us and are kept from
coalitions against us as much as possible by their relations to each other."20
The hostile alliance of Bismarck's nightmare had a significant historical precedent—the "Kaunitz coalition" of France-Austria-Russia that had come
within a hair of depriving Frederick the Great of his greatness.21
The ideal "total situation," then, was one in which every European power
(he would have included even France, if governed by an anticlerical republic)
was bound to Germany more closely than to other powers. But the realities of
the European balance of power tended to make such an ideal situation unlikely for more than brief intervals. Hence his usual objective in the dynamics
of power politics was that which he revealed in January 1880 when lecturing
the Russian diplomat Saburov about the "importance of being one of three on
the European chessboard. That is the invariable objective of all the cabinets,
and mine above all. Nobody wishes to be a minority. All politics reduces itself
to this formula: to try to be one of three, as long as the world is governed by
the unstable equilibrium of five great powers."22 At one time or another Bismarck considered three possible combinations: Germany-Austria-Russia,
Germany-Austria-Britain, or Germany-Britain-Russia. He preferred the first

coalition but was willing, in the event of necessity, to resort to either of the
others.23
During Bismarck's two decades as Reich chancellor the basic tensions that
shaped European politics were three: between Germany and France over Alsace-Lorraine; between Russia and Austria over southeastern Europe; and between Russia and Britain over conflicting interests from the Balkans to India
and China. Other frictions there were, particularly in the colonial world, but
these three were primary, for they determined the relationships between the
great powers. The second and third areas of conflict were for Bismarck a
source of both danger and opportunity. Twice, in 1876-1878 and in 18851887, they threatened to produce the major European war he wished to avoid.
But they also provided the chance for Germany to seize the position of the
fulcrum in the European balance of power, that mobile position between conflicting interests that gave Bismarck the best chance of attaining his twin
objectives of isolating France and preserving the peace of Europe.
Although he believed certain "interests of state," grounded in political geography, influenced the conduct of governments, Bismarck was well aware
that the interpretation of those interests differed from individual to individual
and faction to faction. Naturally he followed the ebb and flow of French political life with scrupulous care. His hope was that the character of the new
regime in Paris would make it incapable of alliances (biindnisunfahig).24 The
events that followed the conclusion of the war with Germany were reassuring.
Civil war between the new government headed by Louis-Adolphe Thiers and
the radical Paris Commune seemed to confirm the prejudice of European
statesmen that France was still the heart of revolutionary unrest in Europe.
The defeat of the commune was followed by a period of indecision, during
which Orleanist and Bourbon factions disputed over which dynasty would be
restored to the throne. This division within the monarchist majority in the
Versailles assembly enabled Thiers to consolidate his position. Bismarck regarded this development as favorable to Germany, for he anticipated that a
monarchical restoration would bring to power conservative and clerical interests that would find sympathy in Austria and Russia.25 As long as German
occupation forces remained in France, futhermore, the maneuverability of
French foreign policy was limited.
Austria-Hungary was the common partner in both of the tripartite combinations that Bismarck tried to preserve as possible options for Germany. Geography, history, and ethnic relationship seemed to dictate a close relationship, once the issue of the empire's position in Germany had been resolved.

lieved in the necessity of ultimate reconciliation. To prepare the way he insisted on a peace at Nikolsburg that cost Austria no territory and no indemnity. For reasons already noted, however, he had little success until 1871.26
The Prussian victory at Sedan and completion of German unity ended Austrian efforts to preserve a south German "buffer zone" against Prussia; simultaneously Russia's unilateral repudiation (with German encouragement) of
the Black Sea clauses in the Treaty of Paris raised new anxieties in Vienna
over Russia's aims in the Balkans. By mid-December 1870 Chancellor Beust
and his subordinates in the foreign ministry had concluded that both internal
stability and external security now required an Austrian-German alliance that
would establish a great "central European bulwark of peace." Reassured by
Bismarck's denial of all irredentist claims on Austria, Beust pursued this objective henceforth with single-minded determination. In August-September
1871 his efforts were crowned with success when Bismarck and Wilhelm I
conferred with Beust and Kaiser Franz Joseph at Ischl, Gastein, and Salzburg,
reaching an informal agreement to collaborate in foreign policy.27
Simultaneously, however, Franz Joseph was engaged in an internal reform
not entirely compatible with his new foreign policy. Without consulting
Beust, he had appointed on February 7, 1871, a new Cisleithanian cabinet,
headed by Count Karl von Hohenwart as minister-president with Prussophobe Albert Schaffle as minister of commerce—advocates of a new federalism designed to appease the empire's Polish and Slavic populations. Hohenwart's new federalism would have elevated Bohemia, dominated by Czechs,
to constitutional equality with Austria and Hungary. The logical counterpart
of such an internal reform should have been a pro-Russian more than a proGerman foreign policy. Although Russian Panslavs applauded this reform, it
was unpopular among Hungarians, who did not favor granting to other ethnic
groups what they themselves had so recently obtained, and Austrian Germans, who saw in it yet another blow to their traditionally dominant position
in the Habsburg Empire. The emotions aroused by the controversy raised the
possibility of an internecine quarrel that might one day lead to German or
perhaps Russian intervention in the internal affairs of the Danubian empire.
Bismarck regarded the Hohenwart-Schaffle cabinet as both black and red
(ultramontane and socialist); he attacked its program publicly in the press and
personally to Beust and Franz Joseph. He was particularly disturbed by the
cabinet's plan to make concessions to the Poles of Galicia, a policy that promised to increase the discontent of the Polish populations of Russia and Prussia.
To his gratification, Franz Joseph finally restored harmony in his government
by dismissing the reform cabinet. Beust's policy had triumphed, but not he.

BISMARCK AND BEUST EMBRACE. A VIENNESE PERSPECTIVE ON AUSTRIA'S "NEWEST FRIENDSHIP." BERG'S
KIKERIKI, VIENNA, FEBRUARY 6, 1871

His cooperation with Austria's German liberals, who had bitterly opposed the
Kaiser's course in the recent struggle, had evidently contaminated him in
Franz Joseph's mind. In November 1871 he was dismissed as chancellor and
sent to London as ambassador. Prince Adolf von Auersperg replaced Hohenwart as Austrian minister—president, and Hungarian Court Julius Andrassy

* Reconstruction in Foreign Relations *

257

replaced Beust as Austro-Hungarian foreign minister. Andrassy was even
more committed than Beust to a pro-German policy for Austria.28
The most sensitive points in Bismarck's conception of German foreign policy concerned relations with Russia and Britain. Close cooperation with Russia had been central to his policy since 1862; it had helped to isolate Austria
in 1866 and had prevented Austria from allying with France in 1870. Bismarck's best resource in Russia was Tsar Alexander II. Alexander was closely
related to the Hohenzollern family, being a nephew of Wilhelm I. He was
increasingly alarmed over the growth of revolutionary radicalism in Europe
and its effects on Russia. Still, there were anti-German elements within the
Russian government. The influence of German intellectual life, very strong
early in the century, was ebbing. Many Russians resented the role Baltic Germans had played in Russian government. Gorchakov had long been partial to
the ideal of cooperation with France. According to his colleague Count Peter
Shuvalov, furthermore, Gorchakov was "jealous of the fame of his colleague
in Berlin" and inclined to "advise the opposite" of whatever Bismarck proposed in order to avoid the appearance of following in his footsteps.2°
These uncertainties made it all the more imperative for Bismarck to leave
open the possibility of intimacy with Great Britain. When Odo Russell came
to Versailles in November 1870 to inform him of Britain's concern over Russia's repudiation of the Black Sea clauses of the Treaty of Paris, Bismarck set
the new policy in motion. He told Russell that Berlin had no secret understanding with St. Petersburg. Their relationship was "an open avowed, unconscious alliance . . . , which he not only does not attempt to deny, but
also openly declares to be a national and family alliance of friendship and
gratitude for past services, which it is his duty to maintain until future events
bring about more advantageous alliances." Britain and Austria, he continued,
were Germany's "natural allies"; for such an alliance Germany was prepared
to make sacrifices.30
This interview signaled the beginning of the "see-saw politics" that characterized Bismarck's diplomacy at crucial moments during the next two decades. His immediate objective was evidently to drive still deeper the cleavage
between France and Britain that had opened in the late years of the Second
Empire. The Gladstone government (1868—1874) made no attempt to snap
at the bait that Bismarck dangled. After Palmerston British statesmen were
inclined to avoid continental entanglements, unless necessary to prevent the
total domination of Europe by a single power. They thought of Britain as a

world power, whose primary concern must be the preservation of the British
Empire. Pacifistic by inclination, Gladstone and his associates wished to re­
duce military expenditures and concentrate upon domestic rather than for­
eign affairs. Continental countries, whose military expenditures were on the
increase, began to look upon Britain as a secondary power.31 "It is a favorite
saying of Prince Bismarck," wrote Morier on April i, 1874, "that he lost five
years of his political life by the foolish belief that England was still a great
power."32
Actually this development had advantages for German policy. Knowing
that Britain was unlikely under normal circumstances to ally with either
France or Germany, Bismarck could promote the closer relationship with
Russia and Austria upon which he had now resolved. Although grounded in
Recdpolitik, the eastern connection had other attractions. In the emerging in­
dustrial age, an era of new social forces and new ideologies, it provided the
best hope of stabilizing the traditional social and political order of central and
eastern Europe. The upsurge of international socialism in the early 1870s of­
fered Bismarck both a threat and an opportunity. The necessity of meeting
the socialist menace was one of the principal arguments he used in Vienna
and St. Petersburg for reviving the Holy Alliance.33 The red scare, fed by the
excesses of the Paris Commune, provided a basis for renewing the tripartite
relationship that Bismarck had earlier denounced as an unnecessary handicap
to the pursuit of Prussia's self-interest. Confronted with a common foe, the
European powers would be more amenable to Berlin's new status in the Eu­
ropean balance of power. The fear of German hegemony would yield to the
comfort of German cooperation and even leadership.
The eastern alliance would also bring together the three partitioners of Po­
land. Through it, Berlin could acquire leverage with which to influence their
policies toward their Polish subjects. Any concessions to the Poles in Russia
or Austria (such as those made by Beust and Hohenwart) would inevitably
have had repercussions on the Prussian side of the border. In this respect,
Bismarck's effort to unite the three great empires of central and eastern Eu­
rope was the external counterpart of the Prussian Kulturkampf and the de­
fense against "Polonization" of Germans in Prussia's eastern provinces. That
the alliance served Bismarck's domestic and foreign policy simultaneously was
a fortunate coincidence that reinforced its value, but was not its primary mo­
tivation.

The Three Emperors League
Although they shared his social objectives, Andrassy and Gorchakov could
hardly accept Bismarck's ambition to control the switchboard of European
politics. Their interests and those of the powers they served differed from his.
Bismarck hoped for Austrian support or benevolent neutrality in any future
difficulties with France, and Andrassy wished to entice Germany and perhaps
Britain into backing Austria in any future difficulties with Russia. In seeking
the German alliance, the Austrian hoped to liquidate the close relationship
between Berlin and St. Petersburg existing for nearly a decade. Gorchakov,
on the other hand, coveted for himself the central position in European politics that Bismarck was beginning to occupy. Hence he refused to surrender
even now the prospect that Russia might establish a working relationship with
France, and he determined, by easing their differences over the Balkans, to
prevent Austria-Hungary from becoming too closely allied with Germany.
These conflicting motives stood in the way of any rapid decisions on the
part of the three empires. In his negotiations with Beust and Andrassy Bismarck stressed that Germany would not sacrifice its relationship to Russia for
the sake of rapprochement with Austria. When Franz Joseph decided upon an
official visit to Berlin that would demonstrate his acceptance of the results of
the battle of Koniggratz, Alexander II and Gorchakov, apprehensive over the
signs of increasing intimacy between Berlin and Vienna, invited themselves,
in effect, to the same meeting.34 In September 1872, the three emperors and
their foreign ministers assembled in the German capital for a round of state
dinners, parades, and conferences. Bismarck hastened to reassure the British
about the results. "We have witnessed a novel sight today," he told Russell.
"It is the first time in history that three emperors have sat down to dinner
together for the promotion of peace.—I wanted these emperors to form a
loving group, like Canova's three graces.—I wanted them to stand in a silent
group and allow themselves to be admired, but I was determined not to allow
them to talk, and that I have achieved, difficult as it was, because they all
three think themselves greater statesmen than they are."35 There was far more
talk than Bismarck admitted. Although no written agreements emerged (the
foreign ministers judged the time not yet ripe), the conference brought about
the reconciliation of Alexander and Franz Joseph and negotiations between
Gorchakov and Andrassy that eased Russian-Austrian friction over the Balkans.
The fact that neither Austria nor Russia could afford to permit the other to
ally with Germany independently heightened the willingness of both to come
to terms. In May 1873 Wilhelm, accompanied by Bismarck and Moltke, re34

turned the tsar's visit by journeying to St. Petersburg. The result was a military convention between Germany and Russia binding each to support the
other with two hundred thousand men in the event of an attack by another
European power. The document was signed by the two emperors and the two
generals, Moltke and Field Marshal Berg, who had negotiated it.3* Bismarck
evaded the Russian attempt to separate Germany from Austria by insisting
that the convention be invalid unless joined by Austria. But Franz Joseph and
Andrassy demurred, unwilling to tie their hands in the Balkans or to guarantee, if only indirectly, Germany's possession of Alsace-Lorraine.37 Instead
they negotiated with Alexander and Gorchakov, who visited Schonbrunn in
June 1873, a more general agreement to "maintain the peace of Europe"
against disturbances from any direction, with more concrete decisions to be
made when the disturbance occurred. This commitment was less valuable to
Germany than the one signed in St. Petersburg. Yet Bismarck was satisfied,
for his principal objective had been achieved. In October 1873 Germany
joined the Schonbrunn convention and the "Three Emperors League" was
born.38
Naturally Bismarck had reason to fear that the existence of the league
would drive Britain into the arms of France. At every successive step in its
formation he reassured London that this development was in no way harmful
to British interests. The Gladstone cabinet did not respond to his suggestion
that Britain associate with the league. Yet Britain and Russia, urged on by the
German chancellor, did come to an agreement in the summer of 1873 demarcating their respective spheres of influence in central Asia. In September King
Victor Emmanuel, concerned over the possibility that a restored French monarchy might intervene in behalf of the papacy, visited Vienna and Berlin in
search of support. By the end of 1873 Italy had joined the orbit of the three
eastern powers. The isolation of France appeared complete. Peter Shuvalov,
Russia's ambassador to Great Britain, judged that "as long as the three emperors hold together, they can impose their will on the rest of Europe. If they
forbid France to make war on Germany, the French can do nothing."39 Small
wonder that Bismarck regarded Shuvalov as Russia's ablest statesman.
In September 1872 the official Provinzial'Konespondenz expressed the government's satisfaction that its diplomatic efforts had been accepted so quickly
and unreservedly by neighboring states, despite the "unexpected" accretion
of power Germany had gained by its victories. This was a circumstance with
few parallels in world history.40 And yet there was still considerable uneasiness among European statesmen about the events of 1866-1871. No Euros' GP, I, 201-204.

pean congress had been called to negotiate and ratify the redistribution of
power brought about by Prussia's victories. The "European concert," which
in 1815-1823, 1840, and 1856 had seemed to prove the existence of a European community of nation-states, appeared to have collapsed. And yet was
Disraeli correct in his statement to the British House of Commons, so often
quoted, that the European balance of power had been destroyed? Surely this
judgment was premature, colored by its political purpose, which was to discredit the foreign policy of Gladstone and Granville.41 At the time, to be
sure, there could be little doubt about German hegemony in Europe. As long
as it was partially occupied by German troops, France could hardly pull its
weight in the balance of power system. Seen from the direction of St. Petersburg and Vienna, the Three Emperors League was a restraining net with
which Germany's partners hoped to keep Germany from abusing its newfound
power.
The willingness of patriotic Frenchmen to subscribe to two huge loans enabled their government to pay off the indemnity much earlier than anyone,
including Bismarck, had anticipated. On September 16, 1873, the last German occupation troops withdrew across the frontier, and, on November 20,
1873, the monarchist majority in the French National Assembly installed a
former Napoleonic general, Marshal Patrice MacMahon, as president for
seven years. France was on its way toward the resolution of its constitutional
crisis (finally accomplished through passage of the "Wallon amendment" on
January 30, 1875). Under Thiers, moreover, the new regime had already begun to reconstruct the armed forces; in a message to the National Assembly
in December 1871, Thiers declared that the reorganization was nearly complete for a projected army of six hundred thousand men. In Berlin, France's
financial, military, and political recovery was followed with greater concern
than was probably justified.42 Moltke was persuaded that the French army
would soon be strong enough to launch the "war of revenge" for which chauvinistic French patriots were already calling. In 1872 the chief of the Prussian
general staff began drafting plans for preventive action that would "close at
last the volcano that had shaken Europe for a century through its wars as well
as its revolutions."43 Although he accepted renewed military action as a possible option against a resurgent, vengeful France, Bismarck was inclined to
believe that active intimidation and interference in France's internal affairs
would suffice to keep the French weak and docile.44

"Is War in Sight?"
In Bismarck's opinion the switch from Thiers to MacMahon in France "worsened" Germany's political position in Europe.45 "A weak, civilian, anticlerical, isolated France had been replaced by a stronger, military, ultramontane
France more capable of forming alliances." Thiers had possessed too little internal support to follow the policy that French interests, if "coolly calculated," would determine. Such a policy would dictate that France "go hand
in hand with Rome" and with Germany's "most active and dangerous internal
foes." "Under MacMahon France has become more attractive to potential
allies; under a [restored] monarchy, to which MacMahon is to be the bridge,
this will be even more true."46 Here the interaction between domestic and
foreign affairs in Bismarck's political calculations is particularly evident, but
it was not the needs of the German economy and of German social stability
that guided him; rather it was his conception of what was needed to achieve
Germany's internal consolidation. His near paranoia about the dangers of political Catholicism to the German Reich led him in foreign as well as domestic
affairs into a series of unwise actions that were not only unsuccessful but also
harmful on both fronts. At home the Kulturkampf disturbed civil peace and
alienated a large minority; abroad it disrupted Bismarck's system of foreign
relations by arousing suspicions as to Germany's intentions toward France. By
1875 Germany was in danger of isolation and Bismarck of being regarded as a
bully who had to be checked before he disturbed the peace of Europe.
Initially Bismarck actually expected to find support for the Prussian Kulturkampf in foreign capitals. The Russian government had long been in conflict
with the papacy owing to St. Petersburg's attempt to suppress the Catholic
clergy in Russian Poland and end the church's partiality for the cause of Polish
nationalism. In Vienna the new government of Auersperg-Andrassy had a
liberal and anticlerical reputation. By its occupation of Rome in 1870 the
Italian government had renewed its long-standing feud with the Vatican. But
even the Gladstone government in London was vaguely sympathetic to the
Prussian campaign against ultramontanism.47 These events and attitudes apparently encouraged Bismarck to put pressure upon the MacMahon government to suppress anti-German agitation within the French episcopacy and the
newspaper press. In August 1873 the bishop of Nancy had called upon Catholics to pray for the return of Alsace-Lorraine. The appeal was read from pulpits throughout the dioceses of Nancy and Toul, which included parts of

Lorraine ceded to Germany. In November a number of French bishops condemned Prussia's Kulturkampf laws as discriminatory and immoral.
The Paris government went a long way toward satisfying Bismarck's protests. It urged the bishops to moderate their attacks and even suspended a
journal of which Bismarck complained. Yet it could not accept Bismarck's
demand that the offending bishops be prosecuted under a long dormant penal
statute of 1819.48 The French ambassador to Berlin, Viscount Armand de
Gontaut-Biron, had the impression that Bismarck's complaints about the
French episcopacy were motivated not only by the Kulturkampf but also by
the necessity of influencing the outcome of the Reichstag election of January
1874 and of the ensuing debates over the iron budget in the spring of 1874.
Bismarck's return to Berlin in mid-December 1873 coincided with a renewal
of hostile attacks on France in the German press.49 In January the semiofficial
Norddeutsche AUgemeine Zeitung declared, "A French government that demeans itself in the service of Roman priest-politics would be hostile to us not
because it is the government of France but because it would be a satellite of
Rome, with which we could not live in peace. . . . As soon as France identifies itself with Rome it will become thereby our sworn enemy."50 Soon afterward Bismarck bluntly told Gontaut-Biron that France must not permit itself
to be drawn by religious fanatics into an anti-German alliance. "In that case
it would be better to fight in two years [or] in one year, than to wait until you
have finished your preparations." The warning was followed by a denial. He
vigorously rejected accusations in the French press that he was advising the
Kaiser to seek in war with France an escape from Germany's internal difficulties. That, he declared, would be a "dishonest act." "We are very far away
from any idea of war. What profit could we derive from it?"51
Bismarck's expectation that the governments in Vienna and Petersburg
would be sympathetic to the Kulturkampf was destined to disappointment.
Tsar Alexander and Foreign Minister Gorchakov were more inclined to negotiate than fight in their dispute with Rome over the Polish church. They
deplored the alienation of Prussian conservatives as damaging to the monarchical principle in Germany, and Gorchakov was temperamentally averse to
following in Bismarck's wake on any issue.52 But neither were Franz Joseph
and his ministers disposed to follow the Prussian example, and Andrassy is
said to have been repelled by the vehemence with which Bismarck denounced

the pope while visiting Vienna in October 1873 (at a Burgtheater performance of Shakespeare's Henry Vi, Bismarck compared the pope to Jack
Cade). Not even the Italian government wanted involvement in Prussia's
feud with the papacy, a justified caution in view of Bismarck's continuing
attempts to undercut the Center party by coming to terms with the Vatican.53
Bismarck's greatest failure in 1873-1875, however, was in miscalculating
the attitude of other European powers toward France. In late 1873 the British,
Austrian, and Russian governments, like their predecessors in 1814-1815,
welcomed France's return to the European balance of power. The other great
powers had no more interest in keeping France weak than in furthering German hegemony. Under these circumstances Bismarck's too obvious efforts to
isolate the French and keep them powerless had the opposite effect.
During a visit to Petersburg in February 1874, Franz Joseph and Andrassy
were struck by the increased distrust of Germany to be found in the Russian
capital. After conferring with the Russians, each took the trouble to assure
General Adolphe Le Flo, the French ambassador in St. Petersburg, that "a
powerful France is more necessary than ever for the European equilibrium."
"Bismarck," said Andrassy, "has lost his sangfroid and his self-control."54
Even the Italian government pleased the French by drawing away from Berlin
and toward Paris. Since late 1873 Bismarck had sought, by mediating disputes
between England and Russia over conflicting interests on the approaches to
India, to prevent a British rapprochement with France. But the effort was
appreciated by neither party.55 In December 1873, Odo Russell reported
Bismarck as saying that "he would greatly prefer to fight it out at once and
declare war [on France] tomorrow than wait until they were prepared to attack." Russell warned that Bismarck's aim was to expand the Reich to include
all German-speaking people in Europe.56 In a personal letter to Wilhelm
dated February 10, 1874, Queen Victoria warned against the "lamentable
consequences" that "might" result from a renewed German attempt to crush
France.57
These adverse signals caused Bismarck to relax his attempt to get the
French government to take legal action against the bishops.58 But he re53

mained full of disquiet about French intentions.59 Over Wilhelm's protest he
inserted a passage in the speech from the throne opening the Reichstag (October 30, 1874) that, while larded with assurances of Germany's peaceful intentions, warned unnamed foreign powers against letting their "partisan passions" give way to "deeds."60 Simultaneously he became unsettled about
Germany's relationship to Russia. Berlin's ambassador in Petersburg, Prince
Heinrich VII Reuss, was absent from his post owing to illness, and the first
secretary, Count Friedrich von Alvensleben, was an unsatisfactory substitute.
Gorchakov, furthermore, seemed determined to heighten Russia's value to
German policy by demonstrating his detachment from it. To this end perhaps
he blocked Bismarck's attempt to get the three empires to recognize the republican Serrano government in Madrid. In February 1875, Bismarck took
the extraordinary step of dispatching to Petersburg a special emissary, Joseph
Maria von Radowitz.
This was the famous "Radowitz mission," of which, like the Alvensleben
mission of 1863, too much has been made. As instructed by Bismarck, Radowitz appears to have limited himself to the coordination of Russian and
German policy toward Serbia and Montenegro and a general reconnaissance
of Russian attitudes (particularly Alexander II) toward Germany. But his visit
enabled someone, apparently Gorchakov, to launch the rumor that Radowitz
had come to seek Russia's alliance or neutrality in the event of a German war
with France, in return for which Germany would support Russia's aims in the
Balkans.61 While his story circulated through diplomatic channels, Bismarck
heightened its credibility by ill-considered actions against Belgium and
France.
In late December 1874 (soon after the Majunke affair), the Norddeutsche
AUgemeine Tzitung published a report received from the French police that a
boilermaker named Duchesne in Belgium, where Prussia suffered from a bad

press owing to the Kulturkampf, had offered to kill the German chancellor if
paid sixty thousand francs by the archbishop of Paris. The result was an exchange of notes between Berlin and Brussels during February 1875, in which
Bismarck, whose hand still smarted from the effect of Kullmann's bullet, accused the Belgian government of tolerating ultramontane agitation against
Prussia and demanded that the Belgian criminal code be amended to permit
prosecution of persons whose conduct exposed the state to intervention by
foreign powers.62 Rumors began to circulate that the harshness of Bismarck's
reaction presaged an effort to partition Belgium and the Netherlands.63 On
March 4 this episode was overshadowed by a startling order from the Kaiser
prohibiting under his emergency powers the export of horses across Germany's
borders. Bismarck had reports that German horse traders had received an order for the purchase ("without regard to price") and immediate export to
France of ten thousand military riding horses. Neither Bismarck nor Hohenlohe, now German ambassador in Paris, believed that the French were planning on war "within the next year; but [the loss of] 10,000 riding horses,"
Bismarck wrote, "would be a blood-letting that we would still feel if compelled to mobilize in about three years."64
On the heels of this development came news that on March 12 the French
National Assembly had approved a surprise amendment adding a fourth battalion to each regiment and a fourth company to each battalion of the French
army. Although the new battalions were for the time being mere cadres, the
German general staff calculated that the law would eventually add 144,000
men to the total strength of the French army. On the basis of Moltke's estimates Wilhelm concluded that by the thirteenth or fourteenth day of any
future mobilization French forces would possess "a great superiority over the
German army."65 Adding to the climate of concern in Berlin was an approaching conference at Venice between Emperor Franz Joseph and King Victor Emmanuel. In Berlin, where plans were under way for a state visit to
Rome, it appeared that the Italians were giving the Austrian Kaiser precedence over the German. Could the "ultramontane alliance" of Bismarck's
nightmares be in the offing?66
Bismarck turned to the newspaper press to spread the alarm. On April 5,
1875, the Kolmsche Zeitung carried a report "from Vienna" linking French
rearmament to an approaching restoration of the French monarchy, reconciliation of the papacy and Italian government, an ultramontane plot to bring
about Andrassy's fall; the ultimate goal was a "Catholic league" composed of

Italy, Austria, and France under the aegis of the papacy. Austria and France
would join in a "revenge coalition" to undo the consequences of the wars of
1866 and 1870.6? On April 8, Berlin's Die Post reiterated and expanded on
these speculations in an article headed, "1st der Kriegin SkhtV War was indeed
in sight, the article concluded, but "this does not exclude the possibility that
the clouds may disperse."68 These sensational articles, believed to have been
inspired by Bismarck's press bureau, created shock waves in the European
press and chancelleries.69 In a dispatch to London Bismarck sought to focus
the attention of the British government on French military preparations,
which, it was claimed, "far exceeded the needs of a peaceful policy and the
material strength of the country." To Paris, however, he telegraphed that the
two articles had "surprised him" and cited a newly published statement in the
Norddeutsche AUgemeine Zeitung, whose purpose was to quiet the uproar. But
Wilhelm himself was "shocked" by the Koinische and Post articles and com­
plained that even the NAZ article was excessively alarmist. 7°

Reprinted in Freiherr Lucius von Ballhausen, Bismarck-Erinnerungen (Stuttgart, 1920), pp.

discussed. The first article was sent by Ludwig Aegidi of the foreign office press bureau to the

To Tiedemann Rossler denied that he had written the piece at the behest of the foreign office.
Chnstoph von Tiedemann, Sechs Johre Chef der Reichskanzlei unter dem Fursten Bismarck (Leipzig,
1910), p. 29. But this was probably untrue. Rossler was a frequent commentator on foreign affairs
for Die Post and may have wished to protect his reputation as an independent journalist. Without
a general directive from Bismarck the press bureau would scarcely have launched such a press
campaign, although the execution was probably left to the discretion of the bureau. While de­
nying responsibility for the two articles, Bismarck expressed satisfaction over their publication.
Concerning the Die Post article, he told Lucius on April 11, "I am pleased that it appeared in an
independent—unofficial—newspaper and that I do not have to answet for it. It is quite useful if
on occasion a very bright light is thrown on the confused situation. Of war there is no talk
whatever." Lucius, Bismarc/c-Ermnerungen, pp. 71-72. See also his reputed remarks that same
evening to his guests in ibid., pp. 72-73. During these years Bismarck frequently engaged the
newspaper press to fight his political battles on both foreign and domestic issues. Sometimes he
dictated the exact wording of the articles, but more often he merely gave a general directive and
did not see the exact wording before publication. On Bismarck's use of the press see Irene FischerFrauendienst, Bismarcks Pressepoliti/c (Minister, 1963); Robert H. Keyserlingk, Media Manipula­
tion: A study of the Press and Bismarck m Imperial Germany (Montreal, 1977), and Winckler,
"Ausbruch der 'Krieg-in-Sicht'-Krise," pp. 671-713. Later when he saw the consequences of
leaving his "press lions" loose to attack at will, Bismarck dissolved the press bureau in the foreign
office (May 27, 1875) and reduced, but never eliminated, his indirect use of the press for the
promotion of his policies. Doubtless his later complaints about the German press's lack of disci­
pline stemmed from the episode of 1875. Herzfeld, Kriegsgefahr von ι8γζ, p. 31. But the fault was
his.

Decazes Triumphs
During the next three weeks the Paris and Berlin governments sought to cool
the dispute by reassuring each other and the European powers of their peaceful
intentions and mutual satisfaction that the affair was ended. But neither Bismarck nor Foreign Minister Louis Decazes was willing to relinquish the possibility of deriving benefit from the episode. Each strove to rally Europe to its
cause—Bismarck for the purpose of coercing France into relinquishing its military expansion and reorganization, Decazes for the purpose of building a
league of neutrals to restrain German aggression against France. That Decazes
triumphed was owed primarily to Europe's reaction toward rumors of approaching war emanating from Berlin and the bullying tactics of the German
chancellor.
On visiting Berlin in late March, Hohenlohe was disturbed to hear "highplaced officers, including Minister of War Kameke, assert that Germany must
attack France before being attacked by her and that, if war was not already
unavoidable, the best course would be to begin it next year."71 Undoubtedly
there was much loose talk on this subject in Berlin during the spring of 1875.
On the evening of April 21, Radowitz, his tongue unleashed by a bibulous
dinner at the British embassy, made some philosophical observations about
war and peace to Gontaut of the kind that Bismarck normally despised.
Radowitz maintained that the crisis had been resolved, and yet he proceeded, according to Gontaut, to pose a rhetorical question: If Paris were bent
on "revenge," why should Germany wait until France had rearmed and contracted alliances? From the "political, philosophical, and even Christian"
standpoint Berlin would be justified in taking preventive action.72 On April
26, Bismarck himself told Austrian Ambassador Count Aloys Karolyi (according to the latter's statement to Odo Russell) that, if France continued
military preparations on the "present scale," it would be ready for war in 1877.
Unless France slowed its rearmament, Germany's duty was "to take the initiative and put a stop to war by energetic measures."73 In its May issue the influential Preussische Jakrbiicher, generally a progovernment publication, carried

an editorial dated April 12 justifying preventive war.74 In the first days of May
both Bismarck and Moltke spoke to Belgian Ambassador Baron Jean Baptiste
de Nothomb about the threatening character of French military preparations;
in addition, Moltke brought up the possible necessity of a preventive war.75
On May 2, obviously at Bismarck's request, Moltke sought out Odo Russell
to say that responsibility for preventive war lay not with the state that attacked, but with the state that provoked the attack.76 War could, however,
be avoided, he said, if the great powers would stand by Germany and show
the French the hopelessness of a war of revenge. On May 3, State Secretary
Bernhard von Bulow informed Hohenlohe of Bismarck's continuing conviction that the "end goal" of French rearmament "remained" that of preparing
the army "as quickly as possible" to undertake a "military campaign against
Germany."77
These continuing threats of preventive action did not persuade the French
to abandon their military reorganization but did enable Decazes to depict Bismarck in London, Petersburg, and Vienna as a menace to European peace. In
a circular dispatch sent on April 29 to French ambassadors, Decazes denounced Radowitz's "strange doctrine" of preventive war (reported by Gontaut) as disruptive of international law and a danger to the security of every
European power, "if it should actually be adopted by Germany."78 Not only
that, he also gave Gontaut's report to journalist Henry Blowitz who used it to
write an article for the London Times, on the German theory of preventive
war. The article was republished throughout Europe and caused yet another
public sensation, like that of the articles in Die Kolnische Zeitung and Die Post
in early April.79
The British and Russian governments were greatly disturbed by these revelations of German attitudes and no longer inclined to accept at face value
the pacific assurances they received from Berlin. Russian Ambassador Peter
Shuvalov, returning from Petersburg to his post in London, stopped off in
Berlin (May 5-6, 1875) to convey to Bismarck and Wilhelm the alarm of his
government. The Kaiser seemed utterly unaware of Europe's fears and uncomprehending when the ambassador referred to them. From Augusta Shuvalov
heard that Wilhelm was gradually weakening and was "completely in Bismarck's hands." On arriving in London he reported to Lord Derby, foreign
secretary in Disraeli's new cabinet, that the German chancellor was in a
"morbid state of mind." Bismarck had complained of sleeplessness and poor

health, talked of resignation as an "absolute necessity," yet "spoke of things
that he meant to do as minister some months hence": he "appeared to think
that all Europe was inclined to coalesce against Germany and was also much
haunted by the idea of assassination." Shuvalov concluded "that fatigue, anx­
iety, and other causes had produced in [Bismarck] a state of nervous excite­
80
ment that may explain many of his recent sayings and doings."
Disraeli and Derby resolved to collaborate with Tsar Alexander and Gorchakov in establishing a common front against Germany such as Palmerston
had created to hold back France in the crisis of 1840. To this end Queen
Victoria wrote personally to the tsar, and Odo Russell was instructed to sup­
port a Russian peace initiative during the tsar's scheduled visit at Berlin, May
ι ο-13. 8 1 Nourished by reports from Decazes of so many bellicose statements
from Bismarck, Radowitz, and Moltke, Alexander and Gorchakov came to
Berlin to express their disapproval. During the preceding weeks Wilhelm had

repeatedly been surprised by journalistic excesses in Germany and nonplussed
by assumptions abroad that his country was on the brink of attacking
France.82 He had no difficulty convincing his nephew Alexander that these
rumors were groundless. In an acrimonious interview Gorchakov had the
pleasure of witnessing Bismarck's discomfiture on being told that Europe
would not sit idly by if France were attacked. According to one account, he
even demanded that the German chancellor give his word that Germany did
not intend to go to war against France.83 Afterward Gorchakov telegraphed
to Russia's ambassadors, "The emperor is leaving Berlin convinced of the pacific dispositions that reign here and that assure the maintenance of peace."
When leaked to the press, the final words came out twisted: "that now assure
peace." Bismarck gave it yet another twist: "Now peace is assured." He never
forgave Gorchakov for what he believed to have been a deliberate attempt by
the Russian to portray himself as an "angel of peace" who had saved France
from German attack. In his memoirs Bismarck even attributed the entire warin-sight crisis to Gontaut's distortions and Gorchakov's puffery,84 but the archives tell a different story. If Gorchakov enjoyed putting his German "pupil"
in his place, Bismarck was the chief cause of his own humiliation.

The Indispensable Man
The rebuff that Bismarck experienced from other European powers in May
1875 was the greatest diplomatic defeat of his career, and historians have long
puzzled over the circumstances and decisions that led him into this debacle.
The diplomatic maneuvers that preceded and accompanied the wars of 1864,
1866, and 1870-1871 have long been regarded as textbook lessons in diplomatic technique—how to promote the interest of state against great odds at
minimum cost. Bismarck's diplomacy during 1873-1875 can be seen as a textbook lesson in diplomatic bungling—how to miscalculate perceptions of selfinterest in foreign capitals sand create a hostile front by making unwise responses to foreign provocations. For once, he blundered badly in the use of
his favorite political tactic—the threat of alternative choice. The option he
displayed to the French—preventive war—was not one that, if defied, he was
actually prepared to employ. He bluffed, and the bluff was easily called. What
had happened to dull the political sensitivity of the man many regard as perhaps the most astute of all practitioners of the diplomatic art?
In the previous chapter we have seen that Bismarck's conduct of domestic
affairs during the same period was also marked by serious errors in judgment.
His attacks on the French bishops and the Belgian boilermaker Duchesne had
their counterparts in his persecution of Harry von Arnim, confrontations
with Jorg and Ballestrem, and conduct in the Majunke affair. The source of
these errors has to be sought in his steadily deteriorating physical and psychological condition. His narcissistic drive for self-assertion and dominance had
encountered, despite great successes, irritations and frustrations sufficient in
number and magnitude to do serious damage to his mental and physical
health. That he came close to murdering an opposition deputy on the floor of
the Reichstag in December 1874 is the most dramatic illustration of the debilitating anger that seethed within him whenever he contemplated the remaining obstacles and hindrances to the free exercise of his will in internal
affairs. Bismarck's futile journalistic and diplomatic assault on France in the
war-in-sight crisis of February-May 1875 shows that narcissistic rage had also
begun to affect his conduct of foreign policy.
Disproved long ago is the accusation that he actually planned a preventive
strike against France in 1875 and was restrained only by warnings from Britain
and Russia. Less ink would have been consumed on this problem, if historians
had known that during the critical months of the war-in-sight crisis he was
actually on the verge of retirement. During 1874 Bismarck often spoke of his
intention to retire on his sixtieth birthday in the following year. Most of his
listeners on these occasions probably assumed, as did Lasker, that the statements were "mere pretence."85 But on May n , 1875, the prince actually dis85

patched to the Kaiser a request to be released from office that, in contrast to
many previous "resignations," has to be taken seriously. At age sixty Bismarck
doubted that he had long to live, particularly if he remained in office. He
expected to fall victim either to a stroke or an assassin.
No convincing ulterior motive for the resignation of May 1875 is discernible. Unlike that of December 1874, this request was not aimed at recalcitrant
parliamentary deputies, to whom it remained unknown. Nor was it an attempt to coerce the Kaiser into doing Bismarck's will on any important issue.
During the preceding weeks, they had been at odds over the cloister act; yet
this crisis ended in late April when the cabinet acquiesced in the Kaiser's
decision.86 Was the resignation designed to unseat another Prussian minister?
When he composed the first draft in February, Bismarck was deeply vexed
over the "perfidy" and "cowardice" of his colleagues.*7 Eulenburg, Achenbach, FaIk, and Persius (a counselor) had ignored a cabinet decision in voting
in the Chamber of Deputies for a motion by the progressive leader Rudolf
Virchow to extend the Prussian county reform act of 1875 to include the
western provinces.** Bismarck was distressed, furthermore, by the failure of
Eulenburg and FaIk to "purify" the ranks of government officials in the Rhineland and compel provincial governors to enforce the May laws. ("In the last
analysis women govern us, and Eulenburg will do nothing against petticoats—
that is the secret of our domestic politics.") As late as May 7 Bismarck spoke
of forcing the Kaiser to choose between himself and Eulenburg.*9 But there
was no mention of Eulenburg in the letter of resignation, and the minister
remained in office until 1878.
Judging from Johanna's letters and her husband's own statements, the motives for the resignation were fatigue, ennui, ill health, and mental depression. "At the time of my return to Berlin in late autumn of last year," he wrote
in the resignation, "I seemed to have justification for the hope that my
health, after a long and difficult illness, had been so fortified by my leave of
many months and by the cure at Kissingen that I could resume the official
responsibilities given me by your majesty. Unfortunately this hope has not
been fulfilled. A brief resumption of my duties sufficed to confine me after
Christmas for several months to my bedroom, so that during the entire winter
I was unable to fulfill more than part of my official obligations. In the belief

Lucius, Bismardc-Ermnerungen, p. 69 (Feb. 14, 1875). In Lucius's opinion the source of this
confusion was Bismarck himself: "Bismarck loses the context [of government affairs] apparently
because of his ill-health or absences. He sees his colleagues too seldom, leaves them without
directives, and intervenes violently once they are already engaged in a definite direction. As I
judge it, all of his colleagues, except perhaps for Camphausen on occasion, have exerted themselves uprightly to further his policy."

that 1 was sufficiently restored, 1 felt duty-bound to resume my service to your
majesty at the beginning of April but was compelled after a few days to go to
bed again and keep to my room. . . . The doctors have told me repeatedly
that my bodily strength is no longer equal to my way of life and that, if I
continue the latter, I am likely to collapse before long." The step, he declared, was "very hard" to take; he would miss his "accustomed activity."90
In the spring of 1875 Bismarck reached a climactic point in his long career.
He had expanded Prussia and created the German Reich. He had turned back
the liberal challenge of the 1860s by appropriating vital parts ofllte liberal
program. With stolen materials he had constructed a framework of laws and
institutions capable of consolidating the empire he had created. In domestic
affairs there appeared to be no significant threat to his position, his program,
and the constitutional order. The Center party was nearly isolated in Landtag
and Reichstag. With the cloister act the "fighting laws" of the Kulturkampf
would soon be complete. Even in the House of Lords the number of ultraconservative foes appeared to be shrinking. Despite two years of economic depression, the coffers of the state treasury were full.9'
For nearly a quarter of a century Bismarck had climbed the rugged face of
German and European politics. Now he had reached a pinnacle from which
he could look down with some satisfaction on what he believed to have
achieved. But he was also worn out from the climb, his nervous system tortured by anger and anxiety. What vexed him most was his belief that those
who should have joined him in the ascent were trying to drag him back from
the summit. One evening, only three days after he had finished his letter to
Wilhelm, Tiedemann found him ruminating about how little understanding
people showed for the difficulties of his position. He expected no better from
posterity. Historians always see things through their own spectacles, he declared. But he did respect Carlyle's capacity to penetrate men's souls. "For me
it is especially burdensome that my personal opponents increase with every
passing year. My calling demands of me that I tread on the toes of a lot of
people, and no one ever forgets that. 1 am too old to win new friends. 1 also
have no time for them. And the old friends disappear from view as soon as
they believe I will no longer do anything for them. So eventually I will be
surrounded only by personal enemies."92
The progress of Bismarck's resignation from conception to execution presents a puzzle. From previously unknown evidence it appears that he informed
members of his family sometime in early January 1875 of his final resolve to

leave office in April. The tone of the letters Johanna wrote to her eldest son
Herbert during the following weeks point to such a resolve. She quoted her
husband as being "tired of living" and rejoiced that he would soon find in the
forests of Varzin and Lauenburg the peace and quiet needed to restore his
health and pleasure in life.93 In mid-February she reported casually (as though
Herbert knew it already) that Papachen was "firmer than ever on his April
departure."94 About this time Bismarck wrote the first draft of his letter to the
Kaiser requesting release from office.95 On February 26, Johanna reported that
the deed was done. "Papa has handed in his request for retirement, and I
think everything will go smoothly. In April we will be able to turn our backs
on Berlin forever." This time she held Wilhelm ("the all-highest old man")
and Augusta (his "master"), not the other ministers, responsible for her hus­
band's condition. The dissolution of a relationship that had lasted almost thir­
teen years, she wrote, would not be easy. "But we are amenable to all arrange­
ments." 96
By March 3 Johanna was less sure. "Concerning our departure from Berlin
I can say today nothing more certain than in my preceding letter. He defi­
nitely wants to leave, but when? He doesn't say, and you know full well that
one does not ask. . . . All our acquaintances here bemoan [his decision]
frightfully—whether uprightly or hypocritically who knows? I always assume
the latter and am convinced that they have already put together the future
cabinet with Harry [von Arnim] ά la tete\"91 In late March her husband spoke
vaguely, as he had since January, of spending a month (now mid-April to
mid-May) in the Sachsenwald drinking bottled "Kissingen water," after which
they would proceed to Varzin. But continuing cold weather outweighed his
need for country air. Johanna still dared not ask about the fate of his resigna­
tion but suspected that "only another long leave" was in prospect.98 In late
April she wrote that Papachen, after a few weeks of improved health, had
again been laid low by "terrible coughing, chest pains, headaches, fever, bad
nights, bad stomach." 99 Unfortunately Johanna's correspondence with Her­
bert lapsed during May, the actual month of Bismarck's resignation.
How can we account for the fact that Bismarck's letter of resignation,
which according to Johanna was "handed in" in late February, formally bears
the date of May 4 and, judging from Wilhelm's response, did not actually

reach the monarch until May n ? If Johanna's letters are to be trusted (why
not?), the prince's decision was known and "lamented" among close acquain­
IO
tances (Lucius and the Prince of Pless are mentioned) in early March. ° One
letter seems to suggest that the crown prince, who visited the chancellor,
I01
knew of it. Did Bismarck deceive his wife and associates about having dis­
patched his letter to the king? Or did the letter lie on his desk those many
weeks, while he pondered his decision and tinkered with the wording? What
the conflicting evidence suggests is a long period of indecision and quandary,
during which he discussed his personal condition and prospects informally
with the Kaiser, who urged him merely to take another long leave.
Yet another factor in the delay may have been the crisis in foreign affairs.
Bismarck's first information on France's reputed purchase of German horses
came on February 26, and news of the intended expansion of the French army
reached him sometime after March 12. Perhaps he persuaded himself that he
should not leave office until he had sobered the French "with a stream of cold
water."102 At the end of April, however, came the disturbing relapse in Bis­
marck's health that Johanna reported to Herbert. Reminded again of his de­
bilitated condition, the prince finished the final draft of the letter to Wilhelm
on May 4. That he delayed its delivery until May 11 was owed to the diplo­
matic crisis. Before the talks with Alexander and Gorchakov on May 10, it
would have been inappropriate to inform Wilhelm officially of his resolve to
abandon the helm. Chancellor and Kaiser were both intent on keeping the
decision secret (the Kaiser insisted that the scribe be sworn) in order to pre­
vent the German public from jumping to the conclusion that the war-in-sight
crisis was the reason for his departure. "°3
Bismarck did not believe that the war-in-sight crisis would do lasting dam­
age to Germany's position in Europe. "The favorable condition of our internal
affairs and of Germany's foreign relations," he wrote on May 4, "permits your
majesty at the present moment to undertake changes, which must soon occur
independently of every human will, but which at the present moment can be
allowed to assume a form that appears purposeful."104 But one wonders what
effect the crisis may have had upon Bismarck's view of himself, whether the
crisis weakened or strengthened his resolve to retire. Did he see in the diplo­
matic triumph of Decazes evidence that bad health was affecting his political

skills? Or did his humiliation at the hands of Gorchakov lead him to decide,
consciously or unconsciously, to remain in office?105 Did he prefer to stay in
power rather than give enemies the satisfaction of believing that they had
forced him out? If so, the greatest consequence of the war-in-sight crisis of
1875 may be one that historians have never suspected. It may have prolonged
Bismarck's career by fifteen years.
Wilhelm was shocked by Bismarck's formal request for release from office.
Apparently he had confidently expected their discussions of the prince's
health problem in February and March to end in another extended leave. In
the letter of May 4, however, Bismarck proposed to use the leave as a transitional period during which to prepare the way for a new government. But
Wilhelm refused to release him, and Bismarck, who could have insisted,
bowed to the decision.Io6 Bismarck remained in office after 1875 because Wilhelm could not do without him and because Bismarck was inclined to the
same point of view. To the grand duke of Weimar Wilhelm wrote, "I don't
know how long he will be able to bear this existence, but I am convinced that
he will be stronger when he returns to his positions. He himself knows and
feels that he is irreplaceable as long as he lives. After him his post will be
occupied, but he will never be replaced."107 The time had come for Bismarck
to retire gracefully from office—both for his own sake and perhaps for the
good of his country. And he let it pass.
105
On May 11, Gorchakov informed an incredulous Gontaut that Bismarck had handed in his
resignation—on grounds of ill health—and claimed to have seen the document. Gorchakov
hoped that Bismarck would revoke the decision, and Gontaut was sure that he would. DDF, I,
452. Apparently Bismarck showed the letter to Gorchakov on May 10, at a time when he did
not yet appreciate that the resolution of the war-m-sight crisis would be interpreted abroad as a
triumph for Russian-French diplomacy over Germany.

assumption was can be seen in Eduard Lasker's remarks to Hohenlohe (Nov. 12, 1874). "Lasker

Bismarck is too much of a demon to let the reins out of his hands. To my remark that the situation

The Change of Front Begun,
1875-1878

He had made up his mind that under the empire the German Princes
would still remain particularists, and he had therefore recommended
universal suffrage in elections for the [Reichstag], believing that
the mass of the people, favorable to imperial union, would act
as a counterpoise. Experience, however, showed that, while
the Princes rallied loyally to the new order, the weapon
which he had devised to neutralize their anticipated
opposition was constantly directed
against himself.
—Sir Edward Maiet, quoting
Bismarck in 1885

Economic Catastrophe and Liberal Decline

URING the late 1870s Bismarck launched changes in foreign and
domestic policy so extensive in scope that some historians have
written of a "refounding of the German Reich."1 Although this is
surely an overdramatization, the chancellor did execute a turnabout
in internal and external affairs during these years. A list of the actions he took
shows the extent and complexity of the shift: an attempt to make the Reich
financially independent of the federal states and simultaneously to reduce the
power of the Reichstag; the effort to reconstruct the "diagonal of forces" in
parliament by reconstituting the Conservative party, splitting the National
Liberal party, negotiating a truce in the Kulturkampf, and destroying the Social Democratic party; his reconstruction of the Reich executive and of its
relationship to Prussia; a transition from free trade to protectionism and the
forging of a new social and political link between agrarian landowners and
industrial entrepreneurs; and, finally, the revision of Germany's foreign relations through negotiation of the Dual Alliance with Austria.
Bismarck's conception of the art of governing makes it unlikely that he
followed any master plan in inaugurating this broad change of front. Indeed
his decisions came individually over a period of years. Yet they possess a coherence that suggests they were, individually and collectively, his response to
a changed perception of how to solve the basic problem with which he had
long been concerned—that of the social and political consolidation of the
German Reich. At the beginning of the 1870s he believed the greatest danger
to that consolidation was state and regional particularism in combination
with foreign foes. This anxiety explains his excessive reaction to political Catholicism. As the years passed, the Reich was welded ever more closely together by the progress of its economy, by the passage of many basic laws affecting all citizens, and by the growth of the imperial government and its
various agencies. Evidence accumulated that the state dynasties and governments had come to accept their new status as federal states, while Bismarck's
success in reconstructing Berlin's traditional alliance with the eastern great

powers eased his fears of a new "Kaunitz coalition." Although his concern
over particularism and ultramontanism by no means vanished, it was now
overshadowed by other dangers he perceived on the domestic and international scene—by the threat of democratic liberalism and proletarian socialism. Henceforth Bismarck's principal objective was to consolidate the social
and political establishments of Prussia-Germany and of its foreign allies
against the possibility of internal subversion.
Bismarck's reassessment of the problem of consolidation was certainly conditioned, if not determined, by the economic depression that struck Germany
and Europe after 1873. Germany's unification had taken place during a period
of generally rising prosperity; its consolidation had to move forward during an
era of economic crisis and social distress. To be fully understood, the events
of the late 1870s, whether in domestic or foreign affairs, must be seen against
the backdrop of that economic crisis.

The Depression of 1873-1879
The capital of Prussia made a poor impression on Arthur von Brauer in 1866
when he first saw it as a student newly arrived from southern Germany. Berlin
was, he reported, a dull city. With the exception of the palaces and museums,
its architecture was tasteless, monotonous, and boring. Most streets were
badly paved with uneven stones and lined by open sewers through which
oozed "a nauseous, sluggish slime" highly offensive to the senses. The hotels
and restaurants were worse than those in southern Germany, and he was
struck by the modesty with which most Berliners lived. Returning in 1872 at
the height of the Grunderjahre, Brauer found the city "swimming in gold and
gusto." "The hunger for profits and wealth possessed the new capital of the
Reich, and even a large part of the once so solid Prussian officialdom and
officer corps had joined the dance around the golden calf with no pangs of
conscience. Swindlers gained large fortunes in a few days. Everyone, from
princes to workers, gambled on the bourse. An obtrusive, undignified opulence predominated everywhere." When Brauer came again in 1874, the
scene was again radically different. "The infamous Grander millionaires had
become beggars; not a few were in prison." Many officials and citizens had lost
all they possessed. "Laborers were either unemployed or worked sullenly at
starvation wages." Many expensive restaurants, once flowing with champagne, had been either closed or converted into beer halls. "The entire city
was depressed and unhappy."2
The depression of 1873-1879 left a deeper imprint on German society than

any other economic crisis before the inflation of 1919-1923 and the crash of
1929. Although the entire capitalist world was affected, the German depression was particularly acute owing to the excesses of the Grundeyjahre. Within
six years wholesale prices in general sank by one-third, those in heavy industry by more than one-half.3 By comparison the depressions of 1857 and 1866
had been brief interruptions in a generally upward trend. Now the German
economy appeared to stagnate. "The years go by," wrote Schulze-Delitzsch in
1876, "and confidence, which is the soul of all sound commerce, does not
want to return; still there is no dissolution of the spell that weighs upon our
economic circumstances. The failure of corrupt enterprises is followed by the
bankruptcy of others involved in their losses. Even those firms that under
normal circumstances could have recovered from the damage they suffered
begin to expire, since the volume of business remains behind the most modest
expectations."4 The business world was gripped by a sense of enduring crisis
and even panic.
As noted earlier, the signs of approaching difficulty were also evident in
German agriculture by the late 1870s. For two decades American and Ukrainian farmers had been conquering an increasing share of the European grain
market. Eventually Argentina and even India joined the invasion. Cheap
land, virgin soil, and superior farm machinery enabled farmers of the American Midwest to produce at low cost; new railways and steam navigation reduced the expense of long-distance transport. Russian grain, which earlier
had reached western Europe largely through Black Sea ports, could now be
transported more cheaply by rail to the German frontier and Baltic seaports.
During the 1870s new machinery overcame difficulties in milling the hard
wheat grown in Russia and America. Under these circumstances German
grain growers began to lose their hold on export markets, particularly in Great
Britain, which for decades had been the best foreign customer of east-Elbian
estate owners. Although it threatened their domination of the domestic market as well, the inflow of Russian grain was not without benefits for eastern
producers. Before it could be sold to the bakers of Germany and western Europe, Russia's hard wheat had to be mixed with the softer variety grown in
Germany. Hence Prussian landowners retained an interest in the export trade
even under changed conditions. It will be shown that as a consequence they
were in no hurry to abandon the doctrine of free trade.5

* The Change of Front Begun, 1 8 7 5 - 1 8 7 8 *

During the 1870s the expansion in American exports depressed grain prices
in Europe generally. Prices plunged on the British market in 1874-1875 and
did not fully recover in the following years. Germany was sheltered from this
pressure by a series of bad harvests during 1875—1881 (1878 was an exception)
that kept grain prices fairly constant. During these years the shortages were
made good first by imports from Russia (1876-1877) and thereafter from
North America. At the end of the decade the rising tide of American exports
to Europe portended trouble for German landowners. Their export markets
were disappearing and even the domestic market appeared vulnerable.6 Nor
did landowners like Bismarck with heavy investments in timber have much
to cheer about. During the period in which Bismarck acquired Varzin and
Friedrichsruh, the timber trade was in a growth stage. Between 1863 and 1872
the increase in private construction produced an expansion in sales of wood
and wood products of from 3 to 5 percent per year. The collapse of 1873 led
to a steep decline in construction with the consequence that by 1879 the
growth rate had fallen to ο. 1 percent and remained at less than 1 percent until
1883.7 During the period 1850-1865 average lumber prices mounted steadily
from seven to eleven marks per cubic meter, fluctuating during the next seven
years between nine and ten marks. Between 1873 and 1875 the price climbed
steeply to more than thirteen marks, but fell to about ten marks in 1877 and
1878. Fuel wood followed roughly the same curves.8
German grain producers of the 1870s were troubled by the price level, not
because it fell, but because it failed to rise sufficiently to compensate for poor
harvests and rising costs. During the prosperous decades since 1830 specula­
tion in land had driven up property values as much as 400 percent. "Land­
owners became rich while asleep."9 But indebtedness and interest charges also
rose. Mortgages of 80 to 90 percent of the purchase price of the property and
100 percent of real value (in terms of yields) were not uncommon. The wages
of rural workers also mounted as landowners competed with industry for their
services. During the Grunderjahre the cost of money, labor, and farm imple­
ments climbed steeply, while agrarian incomes tended to remain constant.
The collapse of 1873-1874 eased this crisis, although wages tended to decline

more slowly than implement prices. Then came the years of poor harvests
that reduced farm income, while encouraging foreign imports. Even the good
harvest of 1878 had its adverse side, for the bounty depressed prices in 18781879. At the end of the decade there were grounds for uneasiness about the
future of German agriculture.IO
The economic crisis of the 1870s had acute consequences of a social, political, and psychological nature. To liberals who believed in the efficacy of free
enterprise, periodic depressions were a natural process by which the market
purged itself of inefficient and marginal businesses. To conservatives, on the
other hand, the depression in industry demonstrated the folly of the Bismarck-Delbriick economic policy, which had lifted restrictions on incorporation, granted freedom of occupation, and liquidated guild and state controls. Except for those dependent upon the export-import trade, capitalists
located the source of their difficulties in the policy of free trade that exposed
them to foreign competition. Many workers, whose wages sank as the entrepreneurs retrenched, were convinced by the argument that the system of private ownership itself, whether of land or industry, was the cause of their distress. The threatened business class was open to insinuations by conservative
writers that the depression was the consequence not only of capitalistic greed
and corruption, but also of a conspiracy by Jewish bankers and entrepreneurs
who had taken advantage of German innocence. During the 1870s imperial
Germany experienced itsfirstgeneral wave of anti-Semitism, one that continued to lap at the edges of popular consciousness and to erode humanistic values even after the depression receded and prosperity returned."
Academic Socialism
In Sturmflut the novelist Friedrich von Spielhagen depicted typical personalities of the Grunae^ahre: a spendthrift and nearly bankrupt nobleman who

whom he dismissed for daring to join the socialist movement. In the background we hear rumbles of dissatisfaction from the urban lower classes, who
strike and threaten violence to the owners at the very height of the boom.I2
Although their real earnings rose sharply in the years 1869-1873 (except
for a brief interruption during the war against France), German workers
sensed that they were not sharing fully in the general prosperity. "[Bismarck]
has done nothing for the working people," Lassallean socialists charged in
1872. "He has not made our lives easier, only more sour year by year, because
of the effect of the economic laws passed with his help."13 The period 18691873 was marked by a "strike fever" unprecedented in Germany, as workers
sought to cope with inflation and exploit the labor shortage. Their demands
were chiefly for higher pay and shorter hours, the right to retain union membership on being employed, the removal of brutal work supervisors, and an
end to the prosecution of striking workers and leaders. Most strikes were spontaneous and local. Many were successful, but the largest—walkouts by Berlin
machinists and miners in the Ruhr and Upper Silesia in 1872—ended in failure. Although brief, the walkouts left behind an increased awareness by proletarians of the need to organize and build permanent strike funds.I4 Another
symptom of the times was rioting on the outskirts of Berlin. The rapid growth
of the city's population through immigration (twenty thousand to thirty thousand annually in the 1860s, peaking at fifty thousand in 1871) created a massive housing shortage for workers; rents soared and overcrowding reached crisis proportions. Tenement construction lagged while builders constructed
luxury apartments and villas for the rich. Unable to find quarters, thousands
of workers lived in shantytowns of their own construction on the edge of the
city. Evictions by the police led to riots, one of which left 102 policemen
injured and 159 workers with saber wounds. The rising cost of living also
produced disturbances in the streets of Mannheim, Frankfurt am Main, Munich, Stuttgart, and other places.15 In the upper strata of society the experience of 1860-1873 raised new doubts about the virtues of laissez-faire and
unrestrained capitalism. "The gentlemen of the bourgeoisie," wrote Theodor

Lohmann in June 1873, "have grown anxious [den Katzenjammer bekommen]
about the consequences of their own legislation."16
Laissez-faire was the only doctrine of natural law that gained widespread
acceptance in Germany during the nineteenth century. Through the writings
of Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and John Stuart Mill, German economists
had come to regard economics as an exact science based on the laws of supply
and demand and the natural mechanism of the marketplace. Spreading outward from the universities into the bureaucracy, the business world, and the
liberal press, Manchesterism triumphed over the national economics of Friedrich List, the corporative social views of Victor Aime Huber and Hermann
Wagener, and the egalitarian state socialism of Ferdinand Lassalle. During the
middle decades the remarkable expansion of industrial capitalism and the
wealth it produced seemed to confirm the validity of liberal economic principles.
Yet even before the collapse of 1873 some observers within those same
groups in which laissez-faire had won its greatest success (academicians, government officials, and businessmen) became uneasy about the growing gap
between rich and poor, capital and labor, and its possible consequences for
social stability. Beginning in the late 1860s, this uneasiness led to the search
for a new social policy capable of preventing or overcoming the alienation of
labor. (Even Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm reflected in his diary that, political unity having been achieved, the next goal must be social unity. )17 The
reforms proposed were numerous and varied. They ranged from modifications
of the free enterprise system to bold plans for state socialism. Ernst Engel,
director of the Prussian Statistical Bureau, which in the 1860s became an
important agency for the training of economists, advocated an "industrial
partnership system," under which employees would gradually be given a role

and Social Reform m Imperial Germany (Chicago, 1966), pp. 47-48. In Feb. 1872 Ernst von
Eynem, a merchant at Barmen in the Ruhr, wrote to Heinrich von Sybel, "Of necessity manufacturing and burgher circles are paying the greatest attention to the social question. But it is
only too understandable that they often subordinate their judgments either to individual interests
or to . . . the collective interests of those engaged in the same kind of enterprise." He called for
"a scientific investigation of the question" in behalf of those "who recognize the impossibility of
the present situation." HW, II, 43. In late 1873 the standing committee of the German Commercial Association (Deutscher Handeistag) was sufficiently aroused to launch a large-scale enquiry, with the cooperation of the Reichskanzleramt and German governments, into "the agitation among workers" and the "dangers it raises for German industry."

in the ownership and management of the enterprises in which they worked.
One of his students, Lujo Brentano, who was fascinated by British trade
unionism, began in the late 1860s his life-long agitation for collective bargaining as the best way to improve labor's share in the benefits of industry.
Gustav Schmoller, on the other hand, hoped to develop a socially conscious
bureaucracy, independent of the class struggle, that would institute social reform, acting under the advice of experts, meaning professors like himself.
Adolph Wagner likewise hoped for a "social monarchy" capable of meting out
social justice to workers on an objective basis. Schmoller and Wagner were
representatives of the "young historical school" of German economists that
"led German economics away from the Anglo-French traditions and developed a 'German school' with roots in the romantic and Hegelian movements."' 8
This group of young professors had no sooner become aware of their common interest in social reform than they were harshly attacked by threatened
Manchesterites. In December 1871 the liberal journalist Heinrich Oppenheim denounced them in the Nauonalzeitung as Kathedersozialisten ("academic
socialists"). "We regard as socialists," he declared, "anyone who proposes a
system of state action to solve the social question." Another liberal critic
charged, "They only lack the courage to be like Bebel and Liebknecht." To
be branded a KathedersoziaUst was a serious matter, for an avowed socialist had
no chance for an academic career in imperial Germany. Although widely disparate in their social programs, the threatened scholars were compelled to
stand together against the assault of the Manchesterites. The latter belonged,
for the most part, to the left wing of the National Liberal party (most notably
Oppenheim and Ludwig Bamberger), men with strong ties to financial and
banking interests, who feared that the writings of the Kathedersozialisten might
provide the ideological basis for an antiliberal coalition composed of workers,
landowners, and government officials.l9
None of the Kathedersozialisten was a political activist. They were primarily
university professors and economic historians who hoped through their researches and writings to reorient German economic and social policy. They
wished to revive and reinforce the tradition that the Prussian state was a neutral force beyond the reach of the conflicting interests in civil society and
dedicated to the common welfare. Through social justice they expected to
bridge the gap between the social classes and construct a more cohesive society. That they achieved public prominence and an audience for their views
was largely owing to the bitterness of their quarrel with the Manchesterites.
In July 1872 a small group of Kathedersozialisten met at Halle to organize a

common front against their liberal foes. Out of this conference came a larger
meeting at Eisenach in October to which was invited anyone interested in
social reform and critical of laissez-faire. These criteria brought together 150
persons (chiefly professors, officials, and a few manufacturers) whose views
were so disparate that Schmoller, who presided, had to insist that the subject
of principle be avoided in favor of specific reforms.20 The subjects discussed
were: more effective administration of factory laws through permanent gov­
ernment agencies; prohibition of child labor; compulsory schooling for the
lower classes; limitation of labor by married women; unconditional accep­
tance of labor's freedom to organize; legal recognition of unions and legal
protection for their treasuries; and the creation of conciliation services and
courts of arbitration.21 A concrete result of the Eisenach meeting was the
organization in May 1873 of the Association for Social Policy (Verein/ur So'
zialpoUtik) which remained the forum for the views of the Kathedersozicdisten
to the end of imperial Germany.
The influence of the association on German legislation proved to be neg­
ligible because of the disparate views of its members and the apolitical trend
that developed in German academic circles after 1870. Yet the association did
make criticism of laissez-faire intellectually respectable and prepared the pub­
lic for the social reforms of the 1880s. The polemics between Brentano and
his associates, on the one hand, and Oppenheim, Bamberger, and finally
Heinrich von Treitschke, on the other, exaggerated the gulf between KatL·'
dersoziolisten and Manchesterites. During the mid-i87os efforts were made by
Eduard Lasker, Gustav Schmoller, and Rudolf Gneist to effect a reconcilia­
tion between the association and the Congress of German Economists. At the
end of the decade the two organizations made common cause against tariff
protectionism and the shift to the right in Bismarck's domestic policy.22 Yet
their common front on this issue could not erase the fact that the Kathedersozudisten, incapable of winning the liberals as a whole to social reform, had
merely introduced another crack in liberalism's fractured facade. Through
them laissez-faire lost its status as the unchallenged doctrine of German "sci­
ence." Their call for protection of the weakest social group in the competitive

world of capitalism led easily to the conclusion that weak industries must also
be protected from the brutal competition of foreign producers.

Growth of Proletarian Socialism
The grant in 1867 of universal, direct, equal, and secret male suffrage in national elections and the abolition in 1869 of anticombination laws opened
new avenues for labor to realize its objectives. The depression of the 1870s
provided the compulsion to exercise both rights. By 1878 wages in the iron
industry, for example, had fallen below the level of 1869. The Phoenix iron
works in Duisburg reduced its daily wage from 3.30 to 2.10 marks; the Heinrichshutte iron works in the Siegerland from 2.50 to 2.43 marks. Louis Baare,
general director of the Bochumer Verein, reported that laborers were willing to
work for 1.50 marks per day "just to keep their positions," although they could
"not exist" on such a wage. The average yearly wage paid by the Bochumer
Verein sank from 1,190 marks in 1874 to 875 marks in 1880. In December
1874 the Krupp concern began a drastic wage reduction, warning that "every
expression of dissatisfaction" would be regarded as notice of the worker's intention to quit; by 1879 Krupp had reduced wages by half, a record by no
means unique in heavy industry. The average yearly income of industrial
workers and artisans sank from 620 marks in 1873 to 558 marks in 1879.
Layoffs were massive. The number of workers employed in German mining
declined from 289,000 to 275,000 between 1873 and 1879. During the same
period the number of miners employed in the district of Dortmund fell from
84,000 to 77,000. Individual industries were hit even harder. Between 1873
and 1879 the Hoerder Verein reduced its manpower from 4,709 to 2,604, t n e
Bochumer Vereinfrom4,077 to 2,507, the Dortmunder Union reduced its work
force by half, from 12,102 (1873) to 6,322 (1877); more than 4,000 were
dismissed in 1874 alone. Of the 30,000 metal workers listed with the Invalidenkasse in Berlin, only 18,300 were employed in 1875. In December 1879
Berlin's chief of police warned "that the continuing loss of wages and jobs and
the very depressed conditions existing in a number of regions is spreading
doubt about the justice of the present economic and social order and dissatisfaction with the existing [system] in an ever larger circle of the population,
a circle that is usually very calm and moderate."23
The effects of this catastrophe were soon evident in election statistics. In
the Reichstag election of 1871 socialists of the Lassalle and Eisenach factions
had polled 124,000 votes (3.2 percent of the electorate) and elected two deputies; in that of 1874 they polled 352,000 votes (6.8 percent of the electorate)
and brought in nine candidates, six Eisenachers and three Lassalleans.24 In

London Friedrich Engels exulted, "The election in Germany places the German proletariat at the head of the European labor movement. For the first
time workers vote en masse for their own people, put forward their own party,
and this is true throughout Germany."25 This success provided a new incentive for unity in the socialist movement. Obstacles to fusion had been reduced
when the Lassalleans gave up their hope of collaborating with the Bismarck
government and the Eisenachers realized the futility of their agitation for a
great-German federal republic. Harassment and persecution by German governments, furthermore, impressed upon the leadership of both parties and
their associated unions the need for a united front. At Gotha in 1875 the two
parties combined to become the Social Democratic Workers party with a common leadership and a program that reflected a compromise between Lassallean state socialism and Marxian revolutionary socialism.26
In the united party two former Eisenachers, August Bebel and Wilhelm
Liebknecht, became the dominant figures (Lassalle's successor, Johann Baptist von Schweitzer, had been forced out of politics after 1871 and died in
1875). Neither had a firm grasp of Marxian theory. Bebel only found time to
study Das Kapital during periods of imprisonment after 1869. They were not
advocates of violence. To Marx's distress the goals outlined in the Gotha
program of 1875—liberation of the working class "within the framework of
the existing national state" and attainment "by all legal means of a free state
and socialist society"—were democratic, but not revolutionary and not international. Yet there was no question but that the united movement, owing to
its republican, egalitarian, and socialistic character, was hostile to the aristocratic-monarchical order in Germany and to the capitalistic system.27
The founding of the Social Democratic party did not end the cleavages
within the labor movement, as the history of German trade unionism shows.
We have seen that German trade unions, in contrast to those of the AngloSaxon world, were politically oriented from the start.28 The Lassalleans and
Eisenachers organized rival socialist unions that were merged after the parties
united. Under the influence of Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler, bishop of
Mainz, a number of Catholic unions (including some Protestant members)
were formed that amalgamated after 1890 and affiliated with the Center party.
Max Hirsch and Franz Duncker organized a chain of labor unions under the
influence of the Progressive party. No one political party could justly claim to
represent all of the German working class. Yet two of the three trade union

organizations—the Hirsch-Duncker unions (left-liberal) and the "free unions" (socialist)—were affiliated with political parties either highly critical of
or fundamentally opposed to the existing political order. The Catholic Center
and Social Democratic parties apparently satisfied the need of their proletarian members for a new human association and spiritual orientation to replace
what had been lost in the shift from a rural to an urban environment. In the
industrial communities provided by employers like Karl Stumm and Alfred
Krupp some workers found a patriarchal relationship reminiscent of what they
had left behind in the eastern countryside. Both the Center and Social Democratic parties ultimately created subcultures with which workers could identify. Each in its own way provided an ideology capable of explaining the total
life experience, a party press for relating it to daily issues, and a program of
activities (youth groups, outings, meetings, and rallies) that absorbed the
workers' leisure time "from the cradle to the grave."
Yet there were, of course, significant differences between the two parties.
The Center bridged the gap between capital and labor, between the older and
newer social classes, and its leadership was essentially conservative. The social democrats, on the other hand, were outspokenly proletarian, anticapitalistic, and democratic. Their emergence from obscurity to become a significant
political force capable of polling more than 9 percent of the electorate in 1877
shows that the party expressed the aspirations of increasing numbers of urban
workers. It also shows the effect of the depression and the growing sense
among wage laborers that neither the Prussian-German establishment nor the
liberal and conservative parties of the Reichstag looked after their interests.
Like their Catholic counterparts, some Protestant clergymen appreciated
the danger of failing to grapple with the problem of social reform. When
Adolf Stocker, a former army chaplain, arrived in Berlin to assume the post
of court preacher and director of the Berlin City Mission in 1874, he was
shocked to discover the degree of middle and lower class alienation from the
church. During 1874-1878, 80 percent of all marriages in Berlin took place
outside the church and 45 percent of all children were not baptized.29 To meet
the threat of social democracy, which was avowedly atheistic and anticlerical,
Stocker founded the Christian Social Labor party, "based on the Christian
faith," and "love of king and fatherland." The party program advocated obligatory craft unions, social security funds under state supervision, and arbitration courts. Legislation was to be sought abolishing Sunday labor, child labor,
employment of married women, and other abuses. The "gap between rich and
poor" was to be reduced through progressive income and inheritance taxes,
luxury taxes, a tax on the bourse, and laws against usury.30
But Stocker was badly outwitted in hisfirstattempt to organize Berlin work's Wachenheim, Arbeiterbewegung, p. 190.

ers. Seeking to "use workers to reach workers," he chose as his political missionary to the lower classes a tailor named Emil Griineberg, a former social
democratic agitator and "ne'er do well" who had found it advantageous to
convert to Christianity. On the evening of January 3, 1878, Griineberg
sought to found the new party at an assembly of about a thousand workers—
mostly committed social democrats—in a Berlin beer hall and was laughed
down. Stocker, lurking in the background, rushed to his rescue—the court
preacher's first political appearance—but his pastoral eloquence evoked more
laughter, ironic applause, and a point-by-point rebuttal from Johann Most, a
Reichstag deputy with a razor-sharp tongue. The assembly voted for a resolution declaring that, since Christianity had not ended need and suffering in
nineteen centuries, socialism was the only path to social justice.31
In Berlin the Social Democratic party held the field against Stocker's Christian socialism even in the antisocialist election of 1878. Since 1874 the socialists had made deep inroads in the strength of the Progressive party, which
dominated Berlin politics, and on the Hirsch-Duncker trade unions, its labor
auxiliary. On March 10, 1878, they demonstrated their strength when
thousands joined in the funeral procession of the printer August Heinsch, a
party functionary. At the end of April even more (an estimated twelve thousand), showed their indignation by marching in another funeral procession,
that of Paul Dentler, a socialist editor who had been jailed, although acutely
ill of consumption, and died in prison. "Who can still speak of Berlin's
'worker battalions' in view of these thousands of marchers?" asked the liberal
Magdeburger Zeitung. "Regiments, brigades, divisions, yes even entire army
corps of mourners were mobilized to pay final honor to those who have certainly died for the cause."32 The concentration of so many disciplined adherents of an avowedly atheistic, republican, and anticapitalistic movement in
the nation's capital, the nerve center of its government, armed forces, and
communications, began to produce anxiety among the wealthy and powerful—including Bismarck. By the late 1870s fear of socialism, the burgeoning
fruit of a continuing economic depression, began to supplant the fear of Catholicism as the chief danger to the consolidation of the German Reich.

Repression
Like many contemporaries, Bismarck was shocked into a renewed awareness
of working class discontent by the communard revolution in Paris during
April and May 1871. Although without a common philosophy or program,
the communards were united in opposing the return of the wealthy, generals,

monarchists, and clergy to power and influence in France. Their execution of
hundreds of hostages (including the archbishop of Paris) horrified governments and people of property everywhere—far more than did the "white terror" that followed the commune's defeat by the army of the French National
Assembly. At Berlin August Bebel irritated the Reichstag by declaring that
the fighting in Paris was just a preliminary skirmish. "In a few decades the
battle cry of the French proletariat will become the battle cry of the entire
European proletariat: 'War upon the palaces, peace to the cottages, death to
misery and idleness.' "33 In London Karl Marx, speaking for the International
Workingmen's Association, boldly acclaimed the commune as the first spontaneous proletarian uprising in European history and a prognosis of the coming revolt of proletarians everywhere against their capitalistic oppressors.34
Established in 1864, the International Workingmen's Association had become the chief spokesman for European radicals. Affiliated trade unions and
socialist organizations were to be found in all European countries. By 1869 its
annual congresses had developed, despite factional and philosophical cleavages, a communistic program that called for the abolition of private property.
Marx's open approval of the Paris Commune and his apologia for its atrocities
were not shared by most of the membership; dissent over this issue deepened
the cleavages within the International and contributed a few years later to its
dissolution. Yet Marx's audacious stand on the commune gave the "red terrorist doctor" in London fresh notoriety in the European press and for the first
time focused the attention of Europe's governments and dominant classes
upon the International as a potential source of subversion. But there was also
a fresh awareness of the fact that the International and its affiliates everywhere thrived on genuine popular dissatisfactions grounded in social injustice.
Even before the drama of the commune unfolded Bismarck began (September 12, 1870) to seek a common front with the Austrian and Russian governments against subversive movements in Europe—another example of his talent for striking simultaneously at two targets with the same weapon.
Although genuinely concerned about socialism, he also found it a convenient
issue upon which to launch the rapprochement that ultimately led to the
Three Emperors League. After the end of the war against France he proposed
that the European powers exchange information on subversives and regard
revolutionary activity as a criminal rather than a political offense, which
would make the offenders extraditable. But Great Britain rejected the latter
measure and refused to participate in a European conference proposed by
Spain to consider steps against the International. Bismarck too backed away
from the Spanish proposal, explaining that he was much too busy in the strug33 SBR (1871), II, 9 2 0 - 9 2 1 .

35

gle against "ultramontane enemies of the state." At Bad Gastein in August
1871 Bismarck reached agreement with Beust on a common policy but not on
joint action in the social question. They resolved: to satisfy justified wishes of
the working classes by changing "production, trade, and prices" where gov­
ernment action could be "harmonized with the general interests of the state";
and to "restrict agitation dangerous to the state through prohibitive penal
laws insofar as that can be done without harm to a healthy public life."36 Here
was formulated the dual policy of reform and repression that Bismarck was to
pursue for the next twenty years.
For the time being repression was more in evidence than reform. During
the war with France both democratic and social radicals felt the heavy hand
of the police. Initially the Lassalleans and many Eisenachers (but not August
Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht) supported the "defensive war" against Na­
poleon III, as did Marx and the International. This changed quickly in early
September when Napoleon fell, the French republic was proclaimed, and the
demand for Alsace-Lorraine arose. In Hanover the central committee of the
Eisenachers issued a "Brunswick Manifesto" praising the republic and de­
nouncing annexation. The five members were promptly arrested by the mili­
tary governor of the coastal regions, General Vogel von Falckenstein, and
were transported in chains to a prison at Lotzen in East Prussia. Additional
arrests followed, including those of two democrats: Herbig, a Hamburg mer­
chant, and Johann Jacoby, a Konigsberg physician active in radical liberal
causes since 1848.37 Although Bismarck and the Kaiser approved of the
Brunswick arrests, Bismarck found the imprisonment of Herbig and Jacoby
politically inexpedient and criticized Falckenstein's ban on the socialist press
and assemblies as an unnecessary violation of the constitution. 38
The most notorious political arrests of 1870-1871, however, were those of
Bebel and Liebknecht carried out by the Saxon government. As Reichstag
deputies, the two Eisenacher leaders had abstained from the first vote on war
credits. In November 1870 five Lassallean deputies joined them in denounc­

the three were, nevertheless, arraigned on charges of inciting high treason
(Hochvenat) in March 1872, perhaps under some pressure from Bismarck.
The result was conviction and two years fortress imprisonment for Bebel and
Liebknecht; Hepner was declared not guilty. For lese majesty Bebel received
an additional nine months and was deprived of his Reichstag seat. During
their trial the socialists had some success in converting the courtroom into a
forum for the propagation of their views. Their martyrdom probably increased
the popularity of the socialist movement among workmen.40 So likewise did
the fate of other editors and party workers harassed and arrested during the
following years by the Saxon police, who were determined, so Bebel wrote,
to "put their colleagues in the rest of Germany in the shade."41
By the early 1870s it had become evident that Bismarck's social policy suffered from a basic contradiction. He had delivered into labor's hands two
potent weapons, the ballot and the strike, but had taken no positive steps to
assure that they would not be used in ways harmful to the Prussian-German
establishment. None of the half-hearted discussions and attempts at social
amelioration during the 1860s had gotten anywhere. Now in the early years
of the empire he was faced with a disturbing combination of social and political woes: the success of the Center party in attracting labor support; signs of
increasing socialist agitation among discontented workers; evidence (convincing at least to Bismarck) of an unholy "red and black alliance" between
social radicals and Catholic clergy;42 the number and dimensions of the strikes
in German industry during the Gruruierjahre; the continued emigration of
farm labor from Germany; and finally reports that striking industrial workers
were joining hands with farm laborers in a common struggle against the possessing classes.43
Initially the Bismarck government sought to meet the problem of strikes
and subversion under existing statutes. In January 1871 Minister of Interior
Eulenburg ordered Prussian police to keep track of "movements among the
workers." As reports from police agents, many spurious, accumulated in the
files, the minister sought to stretch Prussian and imperial statutes to prohibit
or dissolve workers' assemblies, demonstrations, and organizations.44 In September 1872 he directed provincial governments to be vigilant in enforcing
the provision of the industrial code that guaranteed nonstrikers the right to

work. But Bismarck was dissatisfied with the results. He concluded that the
rights accorded labor and its socialist advocates under existing law were too
generous.46 In September 1872 he gained the cabinet's consent to seek
through imperial legislation new statutes regulating the press and the right of
association (Vereinswesen). The government, he declared, could not remain
"passive" when the social democratic press constantly aroused the workers
against the government and the propertied classes.47 Six months later, other
bills were added that would have punished industrial, agrarian, and forestry
workers for breach of contract and limited the right of Freiziigigkeit by which
workers evaded civil judgments for breach of contract by migrating to another
state. 48
For the time being, however, the only repressive statute that the govern­
ment succeeded in getting passed was the imperial press act of 1874, which
permitted confiscation of printed matter without prior approval by the courts.
This statute, which was aimed at the ultramontane Catholic as well as the
socialist press, heightened the power of the police to seize newspapers, books,
pamphlets, and placards whenever they suspected a violation of law. The re­
sponsible editors, publishers, printers, and distributors could be fined as much
as ι ,000 marks and imprisoned up to one year. Although denounced by Lasker
as an attack on freedom of the press, the statute finally passed in April 1874
after socialist progress at the polls had alarmed liberals as well as the govern­
ment. Still the liberals sheared away some of the stronger features desired by
the government, including the power to punish those connected with such
publications without proof of complicity. In the final compromise, further­
more, the liberals secured abolition of the stamp tax on newspapers and the
requirement that publishers be bonded.49
Even without the press act existing Prussian and imperial laws gave suffi­
cient latitude for a conservative minister of interior, zealous gendarmes, imag­
inative prosecutors, and hostile judges to do serious damage to the socialist
movement. A Prussian statute of March 11, 1850, bolstered by a high court
decision of 1875, gave the police extensive powers over associations that dis« SEG (1872), p. 183.

cussed "public affairs" and "political subjects." Paragraph 130 of the imperial
criminal code allowed fines as high as 600 marks and sentences up to two years
for inciting violence between classes; other useful paragraphs were those pun­
ishing lese majesty, slander against institutions of the state, and incitement
51
to high treason. The progress of Lassalleans in Berlin was of particular con­
cern in the early 1870s (socialists polled just over seven thousand votes there
in the Reichstag election of January 1874—27.4 percent of those cast). 52 To
meet this challenge the government transferred to Berlin state's attorney Her­
mann Tessendorff, known for his vigorous prosecution of social democrats in
Magdeburg. On January 1, 1874, the day after he assumed office, Tessendorff
addressed an open letter to Berlin's chief of police, Guido von Madai, declar­
ing that "excesses of every kind, bordering on bestiality, among the lower
classes of the population" had reached the point of "endangering public safety
and morals and justified the strictest measures against those responsible."
Criminals, rioters, and social democrat "terrorists" were listed as equally dan­
gerous.53 During the following months Madai arrested and Tessendorff prose­
cuted dozens of socialists under the criminal code and with the help of sym­
pathetic judges sent many to prison. According to August Bebel, eighty-seven
Lassalleans received jail sentences totaling more than 211 months. In June
Tessendorff obtained a judgment closing the headquarters of the Lassallean
General German Workers Association, although the association had already
dissolved. Wilhelm Hasenclever, who had replaced Schweitzer as president,
was sentenced to two months in jail. Policemen, prosecutors, and judges in
other cities and states followed Tessendorff's example with the consequence
that most of the branch offices of the Lassallean organization were also closed.
After the fusion at Gotha, the united party was banned in Berlin by the order
of the city court. But the social democrats had the foresight to locate their
headquarters in Hamburg beyond the reach of the Saxon and Prussian po­
lice. 54

of political offices could not halt the growth of the socialist movement. Its
progress could be measured not only by increasing strength at the polls, but
also by the expansion of the party press from eleven newspapers in 1875 to
forty-two in 1877.« More damaging were Tessendorff's actions against socialist trade unions. He exploited the resurrected Prussian statute of March 11,
1850, by prosecuting the Berlin carpenters' union, which had Lassallean affiliations, for failing to register as a political organization with the Prussian police. During 1874-1875 this and similar prosecutions in Berlin compelled Lassallean unions (carpenters, masons, shoemakers, plasterers) to close their
doors, and their umbrella trade union organization (Der a&gemeine deutsche
Arbeiterunterstutzungsverband) dissolved. Although their leaders attempted to
evade prosecution by reorganizing and moving to safer environments (principally Hamburg), the socialist trade union movement was severely crippled
for the time being. In making his case to the courts Tessendorff candidly admitted that his purpose was not to punish individual leaders, but to close the
unions themselves.56 Again his example was followed elsewhere, particularly
in Saxony and Bavaria." The socialist trade unions were badly handicapped
during the worst years of the depression, when they were most needed to stem
the decline in wages. Another consequence was that socialists, handicapped
in their pursuit of purely economic objectives, concentrated their efforts on
political agitation.58
By forcing Lassalleans and Eisenachers to unite in 1875, Tessendorff ended
any prospect that the former could be played off against the latter.59 As a
consequence even more drastic steps appeared necessary to quell the socialist
menace. In the Reichstag session of 1875-1876, the Bismarck government
introduced a bill (StrafgesetznoveL·) amending the criminal code in order to
bring political misdeeds within the range of common crime. One of its paragraphs would have permitted imprisonment for fomenting class conflict.60 As
will be seen in the next chapter, Reichstag liberals combined with centrists

and socialists to defeat the "socialist paragraph," which they regarded as tantamount to a "law of exception"—a term still odious to liberals, despite the
statutes they had recently passed against Catholics.
The defeat of the "socialist paragraph" did not lessen Bismarck's interest in
another draconian measure aimed at both socialists and Catholics. Through
the Bundesrat and Prussian envoys to the lesser states he sought throughout
the 18 70s to coordinate action against radical organizations under existing
state statutes.61 But the laws employed were not uniform among the larger
states and were ineffective or nonexistent in some of the smaller states. In
1874-1875 Bismarck gained the approval of the cabinet and Kaiser for an
imperial statute outlawing organizations "dangerous to the state."62 Primary
responsibility for drafting the bill fell to Minister of Interior Eulenburg, who,
satisfied with the repression being achieved under the Prussian and other state
statutes passed during the reactionary 1850s, did not push the matter. In late
1876 Bismarck failed in his effort to persuade the Hamburg senate that it had
legal authority under the free city's laws to close the headquarters of the Social
Democratic party.63 Again he importuned Eulenburg to get ahead with the
project for an imperial statute. But the minister produced only excuses and
promises.64
In May 1877 Bismarck, patently exasperated, again demanded haste. To
make his point, he sent Eulenburg an alarming memorandum received from
Daniel Kriiger, Hamburg's envoy in Berlin. The Reichstag election of 1877,
Kriiger declared, had demonstrated the effectiveness of socialist agitation in
all of Germany. The number of socialist voters had doubled in three years,
despite the reduced capacity of workingmen to give financial support to the
party. "By spreading into the ranks of the so-called lower middle class [Kleinbiirgertum] in the majority of German cities, the socialist electorate has
reached such an importance that the destruction of bourgeois democracy and
the sole domination by socialism over the lower classes of the population appears to be just a question of time." The socialist infection, Kriiger continued,

had even spread to rural areas. In the union of 1875 radical socialism had won
out over Lassallean socialism, with the consequence that the movement was
now bent on political revolution rather than on mere economic gains. A
united socialist movement, he concluded, could only be repressed by a single
national statute uniformly applied by all German states.65
Eulenburg, however, was ailing and inactive. In the summer of 1877 Bismarck apparently shelved the project temporarily while negotiating with the
national liberals over Eulenburg's replacement. Finally, in 1878 he found his
chance. Two attempts to assassinate the Kaiser enabled him to flatten all
opposition to the exceptional law against socialists for which he had striven
with increasing urgency since 1872.

Reform
Social unrest, Bismarck told the Kaiser in April 1872, was a "sickness" affecting the entire civilized world. "The cause of this sickness is that the unpropertied classes, as their sense of self-worth and their claims on the good things
in life gradually rise, strive to satisfy those claims at the cost of the propertied
classes." While advocating stronger laws against striking trade unions and socialist agitation, he insisted that "repression" in itself was no cure. "That can
only come very slowly from the effects of continuing education and experience and from a series of legislative and administrative measures derived from
the most diverse areas of political and economic life and directed toward the
effective removal of obstacles standing in the way of the earning capacity of
the unpropertied classes."66 What were the "obstacles" and how were they to
be removed? At the beginning of the 1870s Bismarck's thoughts about repression were clearer than his conception of reform. Lacking information and
ideas, he turned to the "experts."
Not long after his talk with Beust at Bad Gastein, Bismarck urged upon
Minister of Commerce Itzenplitz (October 1871) the appointment of a committee to confer on urban working conditions, preparatory to a joint GermanAustrian conference on the same subject. The "experts" he recommended
were officials acquainted with social conditions, landowners managing their
own estates, manufacturers, persons involved in social welfare, and authors
acquainted with the main currents of social thought. "Testimony from intelligent laborers is not to be excluded." But Itzenplitz feared that an official
inquiry would merely increase labor's doubts about the adequacy of existing

welfare statutes.6' It was true that Prussia already possessed a variety of welfare
chests regulated by the state: for example, guild funds for journeymen and
apprentices, state funds for widows and orphans of officials, and local insurance funds for miners (Knappschaftskassen), factory and railway workers (L/nterstutzungskassen), to which both employer and employee contributed. Other
institutions beneficial to labor were savings banks, credit associations, consumer cooperatives, and accident insurance companies (the latter necessitated by an imperial statute of 1871 establishing liability of railway, mine, and
factory companies for work-related accidents and deaths).68 In addition, various factory acts had restricted child labor (1835, 1845, 1853), established
local councils to regulate hours of work (1849), provided for factory inspectors
on a limited basis (1853), attempted to abolish the truck system (1849) and
wage withholding (1869). Other advances (including provision for the arbitration of labor disputes) had been made in the north German industrial code
of 1869, which became imperial law after 1871.69
Bismarck was unimpressed with Itzenplitz's argument that discussion of the
shortcomings of this system would merely add fuel to socialist agitation. Socialistic theories and postulates, he replied, had already penetrated so deeply
and broadly into the masses that to try to ignore the danger or exorcise it
through silence would be in vain. On the contrary, the matter should be
discussed as loudly and publicly as possible in order that the masses should not
be misled by agitators but should come to understand which of their demands
were justified and which were not. Obviously the most "burning questions"—
those of hours, wages, and housing—could not be excluded from the discussion. Of the two rival socialist movements, only the Bebel-Liebknecht party
was affiliated with the Socialist International. With the Lassalleans understanding was still possible. There was still time to reconcile most workers to
the existing "state order" and to harmonize the interests of workers and employers.70 Although Itzenplitz yielded to Bismarck's pressure, the committee
he appointed was hardly one to propose drastic action. It met only once (November 26, 1871) and recommended more of what already existed: self-help
through voluntary institutions fostered by the state.71 Although high officials

of the Ministry of Commerce were not of one mind, the dominant views—
laissez-faire and corporative self-help (particularly the views of Victor Aime
Huber)—militated against state intervention.72
Bismarck was not dependent upon Itzenplitz and his colleagues, however,
for ideas on social reform. Close at hand was Hermann Wagener, an official
of the Prussian Staatsministerium, who was in contact with two conservative
writers with strong views on the social question: Rudolph Meyer and Karl
Rodbertus. Since 1869 Wagener and Moritz von Blanckenburg had been urging the chancellor to take the lead in a reconstruction of the Conservative
party that would combine agrarian, artisan, and proletarian interests and relieve the government of its dependence upon the national liberals.73 In January 1872 Wagener addressed to Bismarck a memorial pointing out that to
fight ultramontanes and socialists concurrently was a "dangerous enterprise,"
"for it would drive the socialists even more, and irrevocably so, into the clerical camp. . . . A social Kaiser would be stronger than a social pope in opposing the materialistic tendencies of the present." Although repressive measures
might be necessary against "antinational" elements in the socialist movement
(the Eisenachers), the movement itself could be won, if the monarchy satisfied "justified aspirations" of the lower classes. "Whither the masses turn is of
decisive importance not only for political and parliamentary life, but also for
the character of the army." Conscripted workers would be reliable soldiers
only if their loyalty to the Reich was cemented by concrete benefits.74
In October 1872 Bismarck dispatched Wagener to observe the Eisenach
congress -of the Kathedersorialisten and ordered full publicity on the proceedings in the official press. During November 1872 the privy counselor presided
over the thirteen sessions of a German-Austrian conference of technical experts on the social question and socialist agitation that was the outgrowth of
Bismarck's talk with Beust at Bad Gastein. The Austrians came with instructions to discuss only the Socialist International, but Wagener managed to
open up the greater issue of social reform. Although the participants agreed
on a number of moderate proposals, the intentions of the two governments
were so divergent that no practical result was achieved insofar as Austro-German cooperation was concerned.75 During the following year Wagener,
scarred by Eduard Lasker's revelations of official corruption, was compelled to
estate, one professor (Wagner), and several high officials from the Ministry of Commerce (including the future minister Achenbach). AWB, I, 167-168.

resign. Conservatives like Rudolph Meyer thought Wagener to be the only
"statesman" in the Prussian government "who knows and understands the
social question from the ground up."76 Bismarck spoke of him as his "most
industrious worker," but Wagener's usefulness had limits. Ordered to draft a
statute, the Geheimrat was likely to write a newspaper article.77 He lacked the
capacity to translate ideas into action.
Wagener's departure did not, however, immediately sever his relationship
to the chancellor. They continued to confer and correspond until 1877, when
Bismarck suspected Wagener of participating in attacks upon him by Die
Deutsche Eisenbahn Zeitung. Until that time the chancellor used his old friend
for various missions, helped him financially, and continued to request from
him memorials on the social question.,8 Marginalia on one such document of
January 1874 shows that Bismarck, though interested, was skeptical of Wagener's ideas. The memorial advocated: "abolition of the dominant economic
system" (Bismarck: "How?") through the reintroduction of usury laws (Bismarck: "does not suffice") and prohibition of excessive promises of high interest rates and dividends; introduction of a normal workday defined in terms
of the quantity of work (Bismarck: "difficult to determine") rather than the
number of hours; an agrarian reform that would slow emigration by "transforming the landless worker into a small landowner," preference to be given
to soldiers; a voice in community government for rural laborers in order to
prevent formation of labor unions; aid to industrial labor, including artisans,
by replacing the guilds with corporative bodies to be organized on the initiative of the workers themselves, but to be regarded as "state institutes"; obligatory health, unemployment, and old age insurance; compulsory arbitration
of labor disputes by courts composed of representatives of workers and owners;
and reconciliation agencies to mediate agreements on wages, hours, and
working conditions.79 In October 1874 Bismarck again sent Wagener, accompanied by Rudolph Meyer, to the annual congress of the Kathedersozjalisten.
Their report is studded with Bismarck marginalia testifying both to his interest
and his continuing skepticism. "For me," Wagener wrote, "the chief concern
and final aim is to recombine the disjecta membra of the masses of the population and insert them correctly into the organism of the state" (Bismarck: "ubi,

noyed Itzenplitz. But it also jarred him into action. In early November he
penned a statement intended to guide Prussian officials participating in the
conference. In contrast to his earlier notes to Bismarck, it called for full publicity in the government press to "clarify the interests of workers and employers." While insisting that the conference not stray from the "fundamentals of
the state and civil [burgerlich] society," Itzenplitz called for discussion of Sunday labor, female employment in factories, trade school education, the housing shortage, urban transportation, and social insurance.81 In March 1873 he
sent to his cabinet colleagues a series of concrete proposals for imperial statutes on: the prohibition of child (under twelve) labor in factories; restriction
of older children (twelve to fourteen) to half-day shifts; application of the
factory acts on child labor to all employment outside the home; extension of
the state's power to compel employers to safeguard the life and health of workers; obligatory appointment of factory inspectors in all regions; expansion of
their authority to enforce the factory laws; and an official enquiry into the
conditions of female labor for the purpose of drafting new legislation.82 Itzenplitz had reversed course, but not soon enough to satisfy Bismarck. In June
1873 he was replaced by a subordinate, Heinrich Achenbach, who was more
sympathetic toward reform.
During 1873-1874 mounting concern within the government, parliament,
and public led to a remarkable series of enquiries into working conditions and
labor-owner relationships. In response to petitions, the Reichstag resolved on
April 30, 1873, to ask the chancellor to investigate whether additional legal
protection was needed for child and female factory workers.83 The Bundesrat
followed suit, and the result was a massive investigation during 1875-1876.84
Other petitions complained that the industrial code of 1869 had produced an
adversary relationship between master artisans and journeymen and had left
unsolved many problems of industrial labor, including labor disputes and social insurance. The result was yet another general enquiry, formally launched
by Bismarck, during 1875-1876 into the relationships between employers
(master artisans and factory owners) and employees (journeymen and factory
workers).85

* The Change of Front Begun, 1875-1878 *

Nor did rural labor escape the attention of the Bismarck government in the
1870s. The flight of peasants to German cities and foreign lands, the resulting
labor shortage on the farm, frequent breaches of contracts by workers, the
penetration of socialist agitation into the countryside, and the vulnerability
of regions dominated by large estates to their propaganda led the Prussian
cabinet to institute an investigation into agrarian labor conditions. But the
enquiry consisted only of a series of conferences held by the Ministry of Agriculture. All participants were officials, except for two "practical experts"
(the landowners Moritz von Blanckenburg and Friedrich von Wedell-Malchow), who were included on Bismarck's insistence.86 The conference discussed how to slow down the migration by imposing written, legally binding
work contracts, by increasing the number of landowning peasants through
internal colonization, and by extending to landlords the same financial liability for accidental injuries and deaths that had been imposed on factory owners
in 1871. Bills were drafted, but no legislation resulted.87 In 1875-1876 Bismarck, responding to a petition from the Congress of German Landowners,
attempted to launch a new and more thorough investigation into the real
wages of rural workers, but the other ministers were dubious, and no action
resulted.88 To some conservatives this failure was another demonstration of
the Bismarck government's disinterest in agrarian problems.89 But the real
explanation lay in the decline of the labor shortage in the 1870s and the
easing of the problem that had produced the discussion.90
The enquiries into factory working conditions, on the other hand, were
more productive. Conducted by the state governments under the supervision
of the Imperial Chancellor's Office, the dual investigations of 1875-1876 provided information that became the basis for two major reforms: the two imperial social insurance acts of April 7-8, 1876, and the industrial code act
(Gewerbegesetznovelle) of July 17, 1878. In the spirit of laissez-faire the industrial code of 1869 had freed welfare chests from bureaucratic control and had

abolished compulsory membership where the worker already belonged to a
voluntary fund. The effect was chaotic. The two statutes of April 1876 reintroduced state regulation by regional authorities and limited the chests to two
types: voluntary funds under state supervision and compulsory funds organized
by the state.91 Nevertheless, most workers were still without insurance protection, since existing chests covered only those working in a few heavy industries. When in need, the uninsured had to resort to poor relief, a humiliating and denigrating experience.92
Except for Bismarck's obstructionism the second significant social reform
act of the 1870s—a statute amending the industrial code (Gewerbegesetznovette)—might also have reached the Reichstag in 1876. From Varzin Bismarck
questioned the necessity of new legislation limiting child and female labor.
The enquiry, he declared, had been launched during the boom when industry
was driving its workers hard. "Today the situation has changed significantly.
Supply exceeds demand." Many manufacturers were renouncing profits, even
absorbing losses, just to keep their work forces intact until prosperity returned. If burdened by new governmental restrictions, they would discharge
workers, especially women and young people. He also opposed the imposition
of general restrictions without regard to varying circumstances in different
industries and regions. By shortening the working day and reducing the paychecks of women and young people, the statute would diminish their capacity
to feed themselves and lead to malnourishment. Bismarck's objections forced
the cabinet to set the matter aside.93 But in March 1877 free conservatives of
the Reichstag interpellated the government on the status of the legislation.
Resolutions from many quarters—free conservatives, national liberals, progressives, and socialists—called upon the Reichstag to demand new factory
legislation as soon as possible.94
Under this pressure the machine began to move again. Aided by Achenbach, Karl von Hofmann, Delbriick's replacement as chief of the Chancellor's
Office, drafted three related reform bills, one of which was a factory act.95 But
before he could distribute the bills to the Bundesrat, he received an abrupt
telegram from Varzin ordering him to halt all action.96 Bismarck had learned
of the bills "by accident." They had been prepared, he said, without his
knowledge, without prior discussion in the Prussian cabinet, and in contra91

diction to his opinion (Votum) of the preceding September.97 The outraged
"hermit of Varzin" fired off stiff rebukes to both Hofmann and Achenbach.
Most of his ire was directed at the factory act. In their zeal for the bodily safety
of workers, sparing young people, separating the sexes at work, keeping the
Sabbath holy, he declared, the ministers proposed to interfere inordinately in
private enterprise. If compelled to protect workers against every danger, some
industries (gunpowder, dynamite, glass, poisonous chemicals) would have to
go out of business; others would only survive under the most unusual circumstances. If factories could be invaded by inspectors, why not homes—in
search of loaded weapons, explosives, acids, and poisons? More effective for
the solution of the social question would be reinforcement of the statute on
the liability of employers for job-related accidents and its extension to protect
workers from disability arising from sickness and exhaustion.98
Hofmann had erred on procedure, but he was also the victim of a coincidence. Since his appointment in 1873 Achenbach had set out to enforce the
industrial code of 1869 by appointing factory inspectors even in rural areas
like Pomerania. On July 12, 1877, Bismarck's paper factories at Varzin were
inspected for the first time. Inspector Hertel did not like what he saw: beltdriven wood saws and drills without protective covers and running free while
unattended; papermaking machines unequipped with safety shields; elevated
walkways and staircases without guard rails; a gas-operated machine housed
in the same room with an open fire; a technically deficient gasworks in danger
of explosion. He directed the Behrend brothers, who operated the plants, to
correct the deficiencies by August 15.
Bismarck reacted by inspecting the inspector. He discovered that Hertel
was merely carrying out instructions handed down from Achenbach's ministry." In his reprimand to Achenbach Bismarck challenged the right of any
official to make such discretionary judgments. Factory owners subjected to
such inspections would seek redress by voting for opposition candidates. In

prior attitudes. He found that since 1868 Bismarck and those responsible to him (Wagener in the
Austro-German conference of November 1872) had repeatedly supported the extension of the
factory inspection system, first authorized for Prussian industrial regions in a statute of May 16,
1853. The memorandum dated Oct. 9, 1877, never left the ministry. If Achenbach intended it

brief, Bismarck not only vetoed the imposition of new restrictions on factory
owners that would hinder production, but also chastised the responsible minister for having gone too far in implementing existing legislation for the protection of labor.,<x>
When Hofmann presented (October 20, 1877) a revised draft of the factory
act, from which the offending paragraphs had been removed, Bismarck still
found the bill too strong. Government officials, he insisted, must be given
the power where appropriate to except manufacturers from the restrictions on
the employment of young people between fourteen and sixteen years of age.ICI
As finally passed the factory act of July 17, 1878, banned child labor in factories, mines, and construction work under the age of twelve and limited
youths between twelve and fourteen years to six hours labor daily (exceptions
to be permitted by action of the Bundesrat). The Bundesrat received the
power to restrict employment of women and young people in hazardous industries. Youths under sixteen were required to attend elementary school for
three hours daily. Trade schools (Fortbiidungsschulen) were made obligatory
for youths under eighteen. Workers under twenty-one were required to carry
work books listing their places and types of employment, but without reference to performance. The prohibition of the truck system was extended and
reinforced.
Many provisions of the government bill were significantly stiffened by
Reichstag amendments. The most critical amendment was the reinsertion,
without significant opposition, of obligatory factory inspection (including
dangers to life and health), which Bismarck had vetoed. Last-ditch efforts by
Westphalian industrialists to delay and water down the statute were ignored.
During that same summer that brought the liberal era to an end, the Reichstag, shortly before its dissolution over the antisocialist act, passed a statute
significantly increasing the authority of the state to protect industrial labor.I02
When the Prussian cabinet accepted these changes, Bismarck had to decide
whether to gain the king's veto, secure the defeat of the bill in the Bundesrat,
and start the legislative process all over again. He turned for advice to Albert
Maybach, who had replaced Achenbach at the Ministry of Commerce. Maybach reminded Bismarck that, despite the opposition of the Bundesrat's representatives at every stage in the discussion, the great majority of the Reichs100

tag (including the industrialists Karl Stumm and Wilhelm Biichner) had
supported the amendments. Nothing could be gained by reopening the discussion. Whatever one thought of its value, factory inspection was an established institution that could no longer be abolished. Inspectors could be used,
furthermore, to keep track of radical agitation among workers. If properly
instructed, they need not be an irritant to businessmen. They must be told
not to conduct themselves like policemen but as tactful advisers and mediators. '° 3 Bismarck capitulated. '° 4
The social crises of the early 1870s had reawakened Bismarck's old interest
in the problem of social reform. No less than Wagener and many others he
grasped that concrete action was needed to keep the loyalty of the lower
classes. Their loyalty was, in fact, vital to the social consolidation of Germany's new empire. Why, then, did he not do more at this critical juncture?
Generally the answer is that his collaboration with liberals dedicated to
laissez-faire and the dominance of laissez-faire doctrines within the Prussian
and imperial governments prohibited any dramatic change in social policy.
But there are other explanations. Bismarck's sympathy for employers, reinforced by his own experiences, limited severely what he was willing to accept
in the way of protective legislation. In the area of safety regulations and restrictions on child and female labor even Itzenplitz was more progressive than
Bismarck. The officials who drafted the statutes of 1876 and 1878 and the
Reichstag majority that amended that of 1878 deserve far more credit than
the chancellor for what was accomplished. This raises the further question
why Bismarck was not more active during the 1870s within that area—employers' liability and social insurance—in which he did have positive views
on reform.
The answer here is twofold. On the one hand, Bismarck's health was poor
during much of this decade, particularly in the critical years 1872-1876. His
debilitating illnesses exhausted his nerves and reduced his energies. In domestic affairs he squandered what energy he possessed on an unworthy and
self-defeating project, the Kulturkampf. He misconceived the primary problem facing his government in internal affairs. By the time he reversed priorities in the 1880s the chance to prevent the alienation of labor, either through
suppression or reform, had passed.

Toward Protectionism
Until the late 1870s the powerful financial interests in Germany were divided
on the issue of free trade versus protectionism. "°5 Manufacturers of finished
products who exported their wares or who were dependent on imports of raw
materials, merchants (particularly in the coastal cities from Bremen to Memel), shipbuilders and owners, and shippers in general were naturally for free
trade; they found support in state officials and political economists imbued
with laissez-faire economics. These groups dominated the Congress of Ger­
man Economists established in 1859, which backed government policy during
the heyday of free trade in the 1860s. But they had important support until
the mid-1870s from eastern landowners who exported their crops, particularly
to Britain, and wanted low prices on farm implements. In the Congress of
German Landowners established in 1868 and the German Council on Agri­
culture founded in 1872, they acquired organizations with which to advance
agrarian interests. This combination of interest groups, government officials,
and economic theorists made laissez-faire in tariff policy long seem invincible.
Yet protectionism was never without adherents. Since the 1840s the cotton
spinners of Saxony, Bavaria, and Wiirttemberg and the pig iron producers of
Rhineland-Westphalia—industries suffering from foreign competition in the
domestic market—had rowed against the current. While free traders found
their holy writ in Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations and in the writings of his
German disciples, particularly the emigre John Prince-Smith, protectionists
drew spiritual nourishment from Johann Gottlieb Fichte's The Closed Com'
mercial State (1800) and Friedrich List's National System of Political Economy
(1841). Yet Fichte wrote before Germany's industrial age and List at its begin­
ning. The latter argued, furthermore, that tariff walls were necessary only to
protect infant industries in the early stages of industrialization and that they
could be reduced once domestic manufacturers were able to meet foreign com­
petition—a stage that, it could be argued, Germany had now reached. But
List also opposed duties on imported raw materials and agrarian products. So
the protectionists turned in the late 1860s to the writings of an American
economist, Henry C. Carey. A translation of Carey's Manual of Social Science
was published in Germany in 1863 and was widely read and quoted by the
end of the decade. Basically his view was that protectionism alone would
permit coordination of the interests of industry, agriculture, and commerce.
Protected from outside competition, industry would grow prosperous and pro105

vide markets for agrarian products, relieving the farmer of dependence upon
exports. Io6
The natural battleground for the advocates of free trade and protectionism
were the semiofficial chambers of commerce composed of delegates elected by
businessmen in towns throughout Germany. Since i860 the Prussian (later
German) Commercial Association (Handebtag) had held national conven­
tions at which the delegates deliberated on national economic policy. In 1868
the convention majority called for a reduction in iron tariffs, but only on the
basis of reciprocity with France, Belgium, and Austria. Dissatisfied with this
compromise, the extreme free traders, led by the maritime cities, held annual
conferences at Berlin during 1868-1870 to agitate for abolition of duties on
pig iron and reduction of duties on rolled and forged iron. The threatened
interests petitioned the chancellor and the Zollverein parliament through
their chambers of commerce and manufacturers' associations (particularly
iron, cotton yarn, paper, and chemicals). '°7 Within the upper chamber of the
Zollverein parliament the governments divided on the tariff issue, the mari­
time states for free trade, the southern states for protection, while Prussia and
the remaining states took an intermediate position. In the lower, elective
chamber the issue cut across party lines, the opposing sides forming caucuses
to defend their positions. The tariff act of May 1870 gave the free traders half
a loaf—the reduction of the duty on pig iron by 50 percent (from 5 to 2.50
groschen per ton), the loss in revenue to be made up by increased duties on
coffee.108
During the boom years that followed, protectionists were hard pressed to
argue that either their prosperity or imperial finances required perpetuation of
the iron duties. In the Reichstag the free-trade caucus, led by agrarian con­
servatives, agitated for their abolition, but for preservation of the remaining
duties on farm products such as starch. The imperial government responded
by introducing in June 1873 a bill that would have abolished on October 1,
1873, import duties on pig iron, farm machinery, and starch, while reducing
the import duties on other iron and steel products, also on soda and some
textiles, and ending the export duty on rags (beneficial to the paper industry).
The bill expressed the free-trade philosophy of Rudolf Delbriick but had the
approval of Bismarck and Wilhelm I; only the Bavarian government opposed
it in the Bundesrat. The motivation was practical as well as doctrinaire. At
the height of the Grunderjahre it seemed impossible for German industry to
supply the voracious demand for iron, steel, and machines; foreign imports
were needed.IO»

Even as the Reichstag deliberated, the balloon began to deflate. The collapse of the Vienna bourse in May, accompanied by bankruptcies and suicides, was followed by a summer of uncertainty on the Berlin exchange. The
chancellor's office and the Bundesrat were inundated with petitions and letters from the affected interests, particularly in Lorraine, Westphalia, the
Rhineland, and Upper Silesia. (Among the letters addressed to Bismarck was
one from his own financier, Gerson Bleichroder, opposing the bill.)110 During
the boom, manufacturers who could not get enough raw iron to feed their
machines had petitioned the government in favor of free trade.111 But now
that both the producers and consumers of iron in heavy industry were threatened, they closed ranks in favor of continued protectionism. Landowners and
merchants were left to continue the battle for the tariff act.
For the time being victory in parliament belonged to the free traders. All
that spokesmen for the iron and steel industry (Deputies Stumm, Kardorff,
Vambuler, Hammacher, Miquel, Lowe) could achieve in the Reichstag was a
compromise that delayed repeal of the duties on starch and some finished iron
products until January i, 1877. Therest of the bill remained intact, including
the abolition of the tariff on pig iron. Iia If a subsequent bill should abolish
textile duties, as seemed possible, the prospect arose that Germany would
become completely free trading in three-and-a-half years.
During those years, as the depression deepened and lengthened, the pendulum of vocal public opinion began to swing toward protectionism. Although the price of industrial products fell sharply, the mines, furnaces, and
machines continued to spew forth their products, for heavy industrialists were
reluctant to curtail output. It was better to sell at a slight profit or even a loss
than to let equipment stand idle. To reduce costs they cut wages, executed
mergers, and erected cartels. They hoped to dispose of their surplus products
on foreign markets and had some success. The textile industry had not fully
shared in the boom and was not as badly affected by the bust. Although the
price of cotton yarn fell, so did the cost of raw cotton. Increases in the export
trade took up the slack of reduced sales at home. By 1877, nevertheless, textile manufacturers began to experience lower profits, losses, idle equipment,
and laid-off workers.113
Germany was not, of course, the only country so affected. Wars, diplomatic

emergencies in many countries. Higher tariffs were the easiest solution and,
once adopted for fiscal purposes, they were boosted further to achieve protec­
tionism. Civil War debts led the United States to adopt higher tariffs in 18661867, which initiated a climb to full protectionism in the following decades.
The cost of the wars of 1859 and 1866, when coupled with the effects of the
depression, forced the Habsburg Empire to undertake "tariff reform" in 18741875, 1878, 1882, and 1887, and Italy in 1878, 1887, and 1891. The ap­
proach of war with Turkey led the Russian government to demand all customs
payments in gold after January 1, 1877, increasing costs to importers by 33
percent. During the peace negotiations of 1870 Thiers warned that France
would require higher tariffs to pay for the war indemnity. To this end he
obtained a "most favored nation" clause in the Treaty of Frankfurt that con­
stituted a retreat from the earlier free-trade treaty with the Zollverein. Export
subsidies (titres d'acquit ά caution) gave French iron exporters a competitive
edge in Germany. During 1877-1878 protective tariffs were under discussion
in the French National Assembly; statutes in 1881, 1885, 1887, and 1892
gave France its protective wall. Only Great Britain remained true to the prin­
ciple of free trade." 4
Under these circumstances it was only natural that protectionism should
have gained new advocates in Germany. Whether the last iron duties would
be abolished on schedule (January 1, 1877) came to be regarded as a test of
the continuing power of the free traders. Within weeks after passage of the
tariff act of 1873 the affected industry began to organize to protect its inter­
ests. In November-December 1873 the first steps were taken to found the
Association of German Iron and Steel Industrialists. By 1876 the association
was nationwide, representing 214 firms subdivided into six regional groups.
The northwestern group of Rhineland-Westphalia, composed of seventy-two
firms, tended to predominate. The driving force within the organization was
Louis Baare of the Bochumer Verein. Beginning in 1875, the association's ex­
ecutive council, headed by secretary-general August Rentzsch, decided to es­
tablish liaison with other interested groups in the business community (local
chambers of commerce and machine building and railway companies) and
even to approach "some intelligent landowners," whose complaints about the
land tax could be supported as a quid pro quo. But the agrarians were unsym­
pathetic, and the industrialists retaliated by calling for repeal of the remaining
duties on agricultural products.
Another tactic was to infiltrate free-trade organizations. In September 1875
the association collaborated with the Association of South German Cotton
Manufacturers in committing the Congress of German Economists to a pro­
tectionist resolution by a vote of sixty-two to fifty-eight. But in the following
year the free traders succeeded in getting the decision reversed. An attempt

315

in 1875 to swing the Association for Social Policy into the protectionist camp
also failed. Their successful collaboration with the south German textile manufacturers added fuel to a decision by Ruhr industrialists to found a national
organization representing all manufacturing interests sympathetic to protectionism. In November 1875 Wilhelm von Kardorff—Silesian industrialist,
leader of the Free Conservative party, and author of a highly effective pamphlet, Gegen den Strom, defending extreme protectionism—seized the initiative by summoning to Berlin a group of German entrepreneurs to discuss such
an organization. The result was the Central Federation of German Industrialists. Although iron interests predominated, the Central Federation included
many other interest groups (cotton, woolen, and linen textiles, leather, soda,
paper, porcelain, and matches). Yet divergent purposes compelled the federation to formulate its original program of 1876 in vague terms.115
As the deadline for legislative action on the iron tariff approached during
1876 the Association of German Iron and Steel Industrialists and allied bodies
deluged the Reichstag, Bundesrat, governments, Kaiser, and chancellor with
petitions, statistics, and delegations expounding their cause. Sympathetic
members of the Reichstag were lobbied and the press mobilized. Workers in
the affected industries and the communities dependent upon industrial prosperity gathered petitions containing thousands of signatures. On the tariff
issue class conflict gave way to interest-group solidarity. The breadth and
vigor developed by the protectionist movement during 1874-1876 took the
free traders by surprise. They hastened to counterattack through the Congress
of German Economists, Congress of German Landowners, German Council
on Agriculture, Association for Social Policy, and various local bodies and
conventions. In turn, the free traders of agrarian and mercantile regions
(chiefly the seaboard towns and their hinterlands and the eastern farmlands)
inundated parliaments and governments with petitions and appeals. The
bulging files in the archives of the chancellor's office give mute testimony to
the dimensions of the popular mobilization over the tariff issue.116 Never before in modern German history, not even in the era of unification, had so
many Germans become involved on a question of public policy. In the struggle over the tariff the interest groups, never completely absent from Prussian
and German politics, became fully organized and their tactics more blatant as
they reached for the levers of power. A battle of economic interests had begun
that shortly was to overshadow the traditional cleavages in German politics.
Later we shall see that in 1876 the free traders won the first engagement:

the remaining iron duties fell as scheduled on the first day of 1877. But it was
soon evident that this was not the final battle. As the depression continued
the number of adversely affected interests grew and likewise the discredit of
laissez-faire. The stream of petitions continued to flow, calling now for the
reestablishment of the abandoned duties.117 The Central Federation of German Industrialists expanded its protectionist program to include the whole of
German industry. Protectionists succeeded, furthermore, in committing the
German Commercial Association to their cause, despite virulent protests
from much of the membership.
The conflict over tariff policy, like that over academic socialism, had implications for German political life that were much broader than the issue
itself. German liberals had linked economic freedom (freedom of occupation,
freedom to incorporate, freedom from state regulation and paternalism, freedom of international trade) to political freedom (constitutionalism, civil
rights, the Rechtsstaat, ministerial responsibility, popular control over the legislative process). For a quarter of a century economic and political freedom
had been seen as Siamese twins with a common heart. To discredit free trade
was to discredit political freedom.118 Germany's entrepreneurial elite,
thousands of white-collar employees, and the owners of securities, whose
common welfare was dependent upon the health of the capitalistic system,
appeared to be faced with the necessity of choice between a political liberalism inseparably linked to free trade and a return to the old policy of state
interventionism linked to Prussian authoritarianism. The first road seemed to
lead to financial ruin, the other to financial survival. Bismarck soon discerned
the options and offered the choice.
The "Era of Libel"
In December 1874, Die Garteviaube, a monthly magazine with a circulation
of about four hundred thousand and a readership estimated at two million,
began publication of a series of articles purporting to tell the true story about
the "bourse and corporate swindles in Berlin and in Germany." The author,
Otto Glagau, reiterated and enlarged his charges in two sensational books
published in 1876 and 1877, which were widely discussed, even on the floor
of parliament." 9 He did not limit himself to the sordid story of dubious and

Max Nitzsche pointed out that the union between free trade and liberalism had not always
existed either in Germany or in other countries. In 1845 H. Bruggemann, a well-known writer
on economic subjects, wrote, "To be liberal in outlook and for protective tariffs was for most
people one and the same thing." Bismarck condemned protectionists in his early years in parliament as men of liberal and "revolutionary" sentiment. Nitzsche, Handebpolitische Reaktion, p. 70.

fraudulent transactions in securities. By tracing the personal connections between the owners and managers of corporate enterprises, on the one hand,
and liberal newspapers, journalists, deputies (particularly those of the National Liberal party), on the other, he depicted parliament and press as dominated by the special interests of big business. But he also indicted the bourgeois class, free enterprise, the joint-stock company, the bourse, and the
whole system of liberal economics, which he held responsible not only for the
recent excesses but also for the depression itself and for all social and moral
ills of his time.
"The history of company foundings and security issues during 1870-1873,"
he wrote, "is the history of an unprecedentedly big and impudent, crafty and
intensive swindle such as has never before occurred." Losses suffered by investors he estimated at 1.5 billion thalers, a sum far greater than the French
war indemnity. "But these financial losses are small compared to the wounds
that the swindle has inflicted on the general welfare, to the crisis in commerce
and industry that has ravaged Germany for years and whose end is not in
sight, to the distress that burdens the people, who are filled with a dissatisfaction and bitterness that drives them in ever greater numbers into the arms of
social democracy and has already produced rioting and revolts in several
places! How much prestige and repute have the German people forfeited!
How quickly has the glory so recently won paled and vanished! How much
has been lost in honesty and morality, virtue and religion, industry and thriftiness, discipline and ethics! The worst and most unnatural crimes have become common. Murder and robbery, break-ins and thievery make city and
country unsafe. Deceit and embezzlement spread like the plague. Suicide has
become epidemic. Beggars and vagabonds wander about in droves; prisons
and penitentiaries are overfilled; civil and criminal cases, bankruptcies, auctions, and seizures are legion. AU of this is the immediate consequence of the
company and stockmarket swindles that are chiefly the work of Jews and Semites."120
Glagau was not impressed by the fact that the first revelations of corruption
had come in February 1873 from a liberal Jewish deputy. Lasker, he charged,
had found his culprits only among the conservatives—"dilettantes like Privy
Counselor Wagener, Prince Putbus, Prince Biron, etc." Actually the guilty
speculators belonged primarily to Lasker's own people—"to the children of
Israel and to your own party, the national liberals." Ninety percent of the
stock market and corporate speculators of the "founding years," he claimed,
were Jewish. Many influential newspapers were owned by Jews, and those still
in Christian hands employed Jewish journalists, who constituted one-half of
the entire journalism profession. "I do not wish to kill or slaughter the Jews;
nor do I wish to drive them out of the country. I wish to take nothing from

them that they possess, but I do wish to hold them in check, fundamentally
in check." No more, he cried, should Christians let a "false tolerance and
sentimentality" prevent them from throwing off "domination" by this "phys­
ically and psychically most degenerate race."' 31 In a final book published in
1879 Glagau called for a Kulturkampf against Jews.,22
Glagau took credit for having introduced the issue of corruption into the
public press, which, he maintained, had largely ignored or suppressed it after
Lasker's initial revelations. Actually he was preceded by the Die Deutsche Eisenbahn Zeitung. This obscure Berlin journal, edited by Joachim Gehlsen, set
out in 1874 to prove that the chief offenders were not Wagener and conser­
vative aristocrats, toward whom Lasker had pointed his accusing finger, but
Jewish capitalists and their liberal allies in the Prussian ministries and in the
Prussian and German parliaments. As his notoriety grew, Gehlsen attracted
anonymous contributors reputed to be in "the highest circles of society."
Among them were the conservative journalist Rudolph Meyer and perhaps
Hermann Wagener. Renamed the Deutsche ReichsglocL·, the journal printed
"revelations" concerning the "plundering" of various Prussian state funds by
Bleichroder and the Disconto-Gesellschaft in collaboration with Camphausen,
the Prussian minister of finance. Finally Gehlsen dared to insinuate that Bis­
marck himself was one of the profiteers. Repeatedly jailed for libel, Gehlsen
finally fled to Switzerland. Two successors in the editor's chair were arrested
and at the end of 1876 the journal ceased publication.I23
Although a few other newspapers (Deutsche Landes-Zeitung and Staatsbiirgerzeitung) followed the Gartenhube and ReichsghcL· into the muck, none was
as important as the Kreuzzeitung, since 1848 the principal organ of Prussian
conservatism. In June-July 1875 the Kreuzzeitung published a series of articles
signed by Franz Furchtegott Perrot on "the era Bleichroder, Delbruck, Camp­
hausen and the new German economic policy." A Rhinelander of French
extraction, artillery officer during the war of 1870-1871, former business
manager of a Rhenish railway, and currently secretary-general of the Meck­
lenburg Trade Association, Perrot had earlier published a number of articles
and pamphlets attacking the note-issuing privilege of private banks as an ex­
ploitation of the public for private gain. His campaign against banknotes was
motivated by a deep distrust of capitalism in general. "We possess," he wrote
in October 1871, "a number of state agencies that work systematically to favor
mobile big capital in an unnatural way, to allow it to accumulate in an un­
economic way, and to give it privileges dangerous to the state, and to confer

upon it a position and tendency within the state that quite obviously promotes socialism as a kind of self-defense. . . . Corporations are legalized arrangements for the exphitation of all by some."124
Perrot might have remained obscure had not Philipp von Nathusius Ludom, editor of the Kreuzzeitung since 1872, engaged him to write the "era
articles." These essays, revised by Nathusius, charged that Germany was governed by the "consortium Delbruck-Camphausen-Bleichroder" aided by Jewish deputies and journalists in the interest of the banking industry (five-sixths
of which was allegedly controlled by Jews). "If the financial and economic
policy of the new German Empire and previously that of the North German
Confederation gives impartial observers the impression of being purely that of
a banker (that is, a policy by and for bankers), that impression is certainly not
strange in view of the relationships in these matters among the leading personalities. Herr von Bleichroder is himself a banker; Herr Delbriick is related
to a banker (Delbriick, Leo & Co.); and Herr Camphausen is the brother of
a banker (Camphausen & Co.). And if the monetary and economic policy of
the German Empire always gives the impression of being )udenpolitik (that is,
a policy and legislation directed by and for Jews), that too is easily explainable, since the intellectual author of this policy, Herr von Bleichroder, is himself a Jew. . . . Messrs. Lasker, Bamberger, and their close friend, H. B. Oppenheimer . . . are also Jews and are the actual leaders of the so-called
'national-liberal' majority in the Reichstag and Prussian lower chamber. . . .
Yes, we are at this time actually governed by Jews" and "almost exclusively
for the advantage of our citizens of Hebrew faith and Jewish nationality."
Perrot and Nathusius charged, furthermore, that all major legislative acts of
recent years (uniform weights and measures, common coinage, the incorporation statute) as well as the government's railway policy and its use of the
French war indemnity had been for the exclusive benefit of Jewish banks and
stock market interests. In conclusion, the article referred to the close relationship between Bismarck and Bleichroder, insinuating that the chancellor
himself had been corrupted by the power of capital. " 5
Glagau was merely the most prolific of several pamphleteers who exploited
the scandals of the "founding years" to discredit liberal ministers and deputies
as the spearhead of a great Jewish and capitalistic conspiracy. One of the most
daring was Rudolph Meyer, son of a Pomeranian landowner, disciple of Hermann Wagener, editor of the conservative Berliner Revue, and recent contributor to the Reichsgfocke. In his Politische Griinder und die Corruption in Deutschland, published early in 1877, Meyer followed Glagau in depicting Bismarck
as the dupe of German capitalism. By unnecessarily abandoning "traditional

Prussian policy" and imitating the "caesaristic socialism" of Napoleon III, he
had unwittingly created a "political and financial power" of banking and industrial interests that he could no longer control. Although all financiers were
regarded as sinister (except for a few older private banking houses that had
not lost their propriety in the founding years), the two special villains of Meyer's story were Gerson Bleichroder and David Hansemann (the DiscontoGeseUschaft). With their many capitalistic associates these two giants of the
banking world had competed with one another in plundering not only the
investing public but also the state treasury. With lucrative stock options and
directorships they had bribed high Prussian officials (Scheele, Wilckens,
Wehrmann, Schumann) and leading deputies of the free conservative (Kardorff, Miinster) and national liberal (Miquel, Bennigsen, Bamberger, Ronne,
and others) parties. Dominated mostly by Jews, the great banking houses were
but vehicles of "speculation and usury" engaged in "legalized deceit."
One of their greatest swindles, Meyer averred, was the Preussische CentralBoden-Credit-Aktiengesellschaft, ostensibly founded for the benefit of Prussian
landowners, but actually for their exploitation. Only the centrists and old
conservatives had generally escaped corruption. The safeguards against such
abuses had been demolished since 1867 by liberal legislation, for which Bismarck, his ministers and officials (Delbriick, Camphausen, Achenbach, Michaelis), and the liberals in parliament were solely responsible. But Bismarck
bore the chief responsibility, for "the man of the century" had not used his
immense power to halt the depredations of that "king of the rats," German
capitalism. "As long as Prince Bismarck remains the sole powerful idol, the
German nation will be sacrificed to the empire and the empire to the chancellor—as for the chancellor, he belongs to the Jews and the swindlers." The
only solution was "removal of the present system and of its bearer.""6
Since the beginning of the century bureaucratic reformers had expedited
the development of German capitalism by moving progressively toward economic freedom. After 1867 Bismarck's cooperation with the liberals brought
about the final triumph of laissez-faire. Now at the moment of apparent victory in the economic sphere, a triumph that many hoped was but the prelude
to new political and constitutional conquests, the liberals suddenly found
themselves the targets of widespread popular dissatisfaction. In 1876 Wilhelm
Wehrenpfennig described the ironies of the situation in the Preussische Jahrbucher. "Whoever invested his fortune in bad securities does not find fault
with his own incaution but with the incorporation statute. Whoever lost
money on solid company shares does not put the blame on the transitional
character of everything earthly—which since the time of the Pharaohs has
alternated lean with fat years—but on our false economic policy. The indus"6 R. Meyer, Poliasche Grander. On Meyer see William O. Shanahan, German Protestants Face

trialist complains about tariff policy, the landowner deplores the free migration of labor \Freizugi^<£ii\; both complain about freight rates on the railways,
whose shareowners attribute their losses to the false policies of the state. Arrangements that other civilized peoples have had for centuries (for example,
features of our industrial code) are attacked as harmful innovations. Even the
most pressing and successfully executed reforms, such as our currency and
banking laws, are subjected to a most astonishing mishmash of reproaches and
complaints. . . . Agrarians, protectionists, conservatives, and democratic socialists—all have prescriptions for curing the ills of the world. The prescriptions cancel each other out. If one were chosen, the majority of the nation
would denounce it. None of the dissatisfied groups has a program that is politically and economically feasible, but all deplore the existing laws and the
factors that have brought them about."127
Throughout central Europe liberalism had been struck by a crisis of confidence of near catastrophic proportions, not only with regard to the doctrines
of classical economic theory, but also with regard to its individualistic social
ethic. What surfaced here was not just a dispute about public policy and a
search for scapegoats. The attack on liberals and Jews was a symptom of the
uneasiness felt by many Germans about the economic and social revolution
of their time. They lived in an era of accelerating change in which a familiar
environment, sanctified by tradition, was being rapidly eroded and replaced
by another filled with unknown hazards. Bourgeois and aristocrats alike feared
that the liberal era had produced in industrial capitalism a monster that would
devour its progeny. The crash and ensuing depression brought out many latent anxieties—hatred of the Jew, particularly of Jewish politicians and businessmen, Mittelstand fears of impoverishment and proletarianization, apprehension over socialist subversion of the economic and social order, suspicion
of the wealthy and their ambitions to enrich themselves at the cost of the
many—of the kind that in a later age were to culminate in National Socialism.

(¾^¾^) N JUNE 4, 1875, Bismarck, his request for retirement refused, went
f-i^SB^ on an extended leave that lasted until November 20. In past years
o V j T ^ ) he had often begun his recuperation in the baths at Bad Kissingen.
^vi^^y But in 1875 he decided against returning to the scene of Kallmann's
attack and spent summer and fall at Varzin. There he tried to follow the Kissingen routine; yet six weeks of saline baths left him weak and scarcely able
to walk, much less ride. So he undertook a new regimen of "malt and brine
baths" that seemed to be more successful. In early September Hohenlohe
found him looking "fairly well" and walking, although still complaining that
his health was poor in comparison with the previous year. Lucius, who was
summoned to Varzin at the end of October, wrote that the prince "looked
well" but complained of rheumatism in shoulder and chest and of intensive
heartburn. Struck reported that his patient was also bothered by phlebitis,
which hindered standing.' Delbriick and others shouldered many of the routine burdens in Berlin, but the chancellor was not able to separate himself
completely from the cares of office. In June the attacks of Perrot in the Kreuzzeitung disturbed his peace; in August and September rebellions against Turkish rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina began to trouble Europe's chancelleries;
and the work of the commission drafting imperial law codes also caused concern.2 Still, his working hours were greatly reduced. In the solitude of Hither
Pomerania Bismarck had time to think.
As related, Bismarck's request for release from office in May 1875 cannot
be dismissed as a charade or political maneuver. Yet it may be doubted
whether, if the Kaiser had granted it, Bismarck would have been satisfied to
remain idle for long. Even in his debilitated condition, he was still driven by
the same restless energy, the same insatiable need to dominate and control,
that he had always displayed. While he sat under the oaks and beeches at
Varzin, ideas moved about in his mind like molecules in solution. They centered upon two problems: how to continue consolidation of the imperial government, but in a conservative rather than liberal direction, that is, at the

cost of the Reichstag more than of the states; and how to consolidate his own
authority over the executive organs of Prussia and the Reich, while strengthening their coordination. Most of his actions during the next four years in
domestic affairs stemmed from perceptions formed and initial decisions made
during his Pomeranian recuperation of 1875.
Two Basic Decisions
Sometime during the winter of 1875-1876, Bismarck sketched his mood and
intentions for the benefit of a group of friendly deputies. "I am bored. The
great tasks are done. The German Reich has been erected. It is recognized
and respected by all states and nations. We will know how to prevent coalitions of the kind that are usually formed against a state that has achieved great
things. If France should have ideas of revenge, it will find no allies against us,
and without them it will dare nothing. In view of these circumstances what
is left for me to do?" He was, he declared, "too tired" to hunt rabbits, but "a
big and powerful wild boar, perhaps an Erymanthian," would be a different
matter. "To give the German Reich a powerful, unshakable fiscal foundation,
which would provide the Reich with a dominating position and bring it into
organic union with all public interests in the state, province, county, and
community—that would be a great and worthy task that could stir me to expend the last of my declining strength. The task is difficult in itself. Actually
I am not an expert in these areas, and my present advisers, industrious though
they may be in conducting day-to-day business, have no creative ideas. They
move on worn-out tracks. I have no other recourse than to conceive the reform ideas myself and to use whatever instruments I can find to execute
them."3
The implications of this new goal were enormous. To strengthen the Reich
financially was to heighten the unitary principle at the cost of the federal.
Ordinarily this would have been applauded by liberal nationalists and deplored by conservatives and by state governments. But much more was involved than merely a shift from federalism to centralism. New sources of income for the Reich would reduce and perhaps abolish the state assessments
(Matrikuiarbeitrdge), which in the late 1860s and again in the late 1870s disordered the finances of the states. Their abolition would also gravely reduce
the power of the Reichstag, which had found in the assessments a surrogate
for its inadequate power over the purse. Since imperial taxes could be collected indefinitely once granted and since tax laws could only be changed
3
BP, I, 86-88. Poschinger gives no source and no exact date for these remarks. But they are
descriptive of the mood in which Bismarck returned from Varzin in late 1875. On Apr. 21, 1873,
he told Lucius, "Everything is now unexciting and boring, but the nation will again one day
experience an intense heat that will bring the brittle metals to the melting point." Lucius, Bismarck'Erinmerungen, p. 29.

324

* The Change of Front Begun, 1875-1878 *

with the approval of the Bundesrat, Kaiser (who signed), and chancellor (who
countersigned), the Reichstag had no effective control over the income of the
Reich except through its power to set the amount of the state assessments in
the annual budget. Those same assessments were also a surrogate for the Prussian Landtag's inadequate authority over appropriations. Through the Reichstag's power to legislate the Prussian assessment the liberals had acquired leverage on the Prussian government. In some degree they could plug the
loophole in the Prussian constitution that had enabled the Bismarck government to expend state revenues for four years without a legal budget. In 1875
Bismarck returned to the program of "fiscal reform" that had failed in 18681869."
In October 1875 Bismarck's old friend, the conservative leader Moritz von
Blanckenburg, spent a few days in Varzin and on his return exulted to Roon
that the "collapse of the liberal domination of parliament and cabinet" and
of the prevailing economic policy (Manchesterism) was in prospect. While
prophesying a "rosier" future, Blanckenburg admitted that he was baffled
about how to attain it; he feared this was true of Bismarck as well. In December, after seeing Bismarck again in Berlin, Blanckenburg confirmed his earlier
impressions. "Politically the situation is very confused. Bismarck is honest in
his desire to be free of the spirits that he evoked; yet I cannot see the hole
through which they will vanish. If it were just a matter of the old Prussia,
then it would not be difficult to believe in the possibility of a healthy restoration . . . but in Germany the parties jostle one another so violently and in
so many ways that I don't know how Bismarck will get rid of the present
majority."5
To be rid of one majority required creation of another. Despite frequent
grumbling, the Reichstag conservatives, "new conservatives" of the Landtag,
and free conservatives in both chambers had never ceased to support what
Bismarck wanted, even in the Kulturkampf. Ways had to be found to restore
the strength these caucuses had lost by reconciling the "old conservatives"
and by disabusing the voters who in the elections of 1873-1874 had mistakenly assumed that they were supporting Bismarck's aims in the Kulturkampf
by voting for liberal rather than conservative candidates. Nevertheless, it was
obvious that the conservative parties and factions could never supply by
themselves the majority Bismarck required. Thus far all attempts to expand
the conservatives from a Prussian party identified exclusively with the interests of the eastern gentry into a national party representing a broader spectrum
of the population had failed. Hence the new majority had to be composed of
liberals as well as loyal conservatives. In December 1875 Bismarck revealed
his aims to Lucius: "a division of the national liberals, strengthening of its

right wing, and weakening of the Progressive party."6 By driving the Lasker
wing out of the National Liberal party, Bismarck intended to sever the party's
connection with the progressives and make it a suitable partner for the conservatives. Even if this combination did not produce a majority, it would
hopefully provide a solid base from which to construct temporary alliances
with other parties and political fragments on specific issues.
To achieve these objectives issues were needed, issues capable of reshaping
both the party structure and constitutional relationships. During the next four
years Bismarck probed steadily for the hidden valves and sluices that would
release the forces he needed simultaneously to solidify the Reich financially,
depress the powers of the Reichstag, and create a new majority. In the past
the forces he had tapped were idealistic and ideological as well as material and
social, but now most belonged to the latter categories. Out of the channels
that Bismarck discovered in the late 1870s flowed a new combination of economic and social interests that dominated Germany long after he departed
from the scene. A distinction must be made, however, between the problem
as he originally conceived it, the means he found (as he progressed) for its
solution, and the intended and unintended effects produced by his employment of those means. The problem with which he began in the fall of 1875
concerned the distribution of power between the Reich and the states and
between the Reich executive and the Reichstag. His solution required the
reconstruction of the Reichstag majority. In his search for a reconstructed
majority, he altered the relationships between leading interest groups in German society. Yet the original problem remained unsolved, for he never succeeded in building an enduring new majority that would accept the solution
he intended or in giving the Reich an independent financial structure. This
will be shown as the rest of Bismarck's story unfolds.
That Bismarck was primarily concerned in the last half of 1875 with matters of power is also shown by his conception of another issue—that of his
relationship as chancellor to the executive organs of the Reich and Prussia.
Now that he had resolved to stay in the driver's seat, he was determined to
improve his grip on the reins. During 1875 his complaints about the lassitude,
independence, and even obstructionism of his ministerial colleagues multiplied. FaIk, Achenbach, Camphausen, and Eulenburg were his chief targets;
only Friedenthal, the minister of agriculture, seemed to perform to his satisfaction, which Bismarck attributed to the fact that Friedenthal, like himself
a wealthy landowner, was a man of practical affairs. This was an old song,
now sung more often.7 Yet the most notable development of 1875 was the
prince's increasing dissatisfaction with Rudolf Delbriick. In the spring he

"complained bitterly" to Baron von Friesen, the Saxon envoy in Berlin, that
Delbriick "entirely misconceives his position. He is nothing more than his
[Bismarck's] subordinate and as such has to carry out Bismarck's orders and
ideas, not his own ideas and decisions. But he fails completely to understand
this. Outwardly he always acts as though he himself were the authoritative
and decisive personality, and as a consequence he has also brought it about
that others, including the press, actually see him as such. But he, the Reich
chancellor, cannot let that be, for it damages his [Bismarck's] prestige and
makes his position more difficult. He would have willingly broken with Delbriick long ago, but he cannot yet do it, for Delbriick is still indispensable,
and he has at the moment no one whom he can put in his place."8 Delbriick
cast a shadow and Bismarck found it chilling—even though it reached no
higher than the rim of his boots.
By August Bismarck had changed his mind about Delbriick's indispensability. On a visit to Varzin Baron Hermann von Mittnacht, leading member of
the Wiirttemberg delegation to the Bundesrat and chief representative of his
government in Berlin, heard from the chancellor that Delbriick wished to
retire—on grounds of health! Mittnacht was dismayed, protesting that members of the Bundesrat would regard Delbriick's departure as a "great loss." But
Bismarck's view was different. "The prince said that too much had been concentrated in the Imperial Chancellor's Office rather than in the imperial
chancellor, who must remain the solely responsible top leader. The machine
has become too powerful in Bismarck's opinion. Departments must be established with greater independence; for example, the judicial section [of the
chancellor's office] could be independent. The personality of the president of
the chancellor's office [Delbriick] is imprinted on all the office's affairs. Bundesrat committees should exercise more active control over it. If we create
independent departments without reducing the competencies of the Bundesrat, imperial ministries will not be needed. More ministries are also needed in
Prussia. The ministries of finance and commerce could be divided, and there
should be one minister of justice for legislation and a second for judicial administration."9 Bismarck had decided to heighten his control over the executive apparatus of both the Reich and Prussia by applying the classic principle
of Realpolitik: divide et impera.
The Program's Debut

he requested several weeks additional leave ("every year the colder period has

done me the best service"). On October 27 the Reichstag convened amid
doubts that the prince was any longer capable of carrying out his functions.
Eugen Richter charged that the chancellor was "becoming more and more for
us a mythical person." Only his underlings were visible during much of the
year. How wise was an arrangement that made the orderly transaction of government business dependent upon the "nerves of a single man?"10 On November 20 Bismarck reached the Wilhelmstrasse and two days later made his first
appearance in the Reichstag. He looked worn and tired, spoke in a low voice,
made grammatical mistakes, and groped even longer than usual for the right
words. At last the Vesuvius of German politics appeared exhausted. "He will
do us no more harm!" exulted a liberal deputy."
Obviously stung by Richter's assault, Bismarck uttered a few self-righteous
words about the sense of duty that had kept him in office for a quarter of a
century, despite bad health, to which Richter and his ilk had contributed.
Then he began what appeared to be a spontaneous discourse on taxes. Under
debate were government bills for new stamp taxes on stock market transactions and securities and for an increase in the brewing tax-—all for the purpose
of covering an anticipated deficit in the imperial budget for 1876. The Reich,
Bismarck declared, was still young; it needed to be further consolidated with
new institutions and to be made financially independent of the states if it was
to conquer particularism (especially Prussia's) and weather future storms.
There was a way to achieve simultaneously the financial independence of the
Reich and "tax reform" (that is, a shift from direct to indirect taxes). Increases in the indirect taxes allotted to the empire would reduce and eventually abolish the state assessments (Matrikuhrbeitrage); this in turn would make
possible the reduction of direct taxes levied by the states. "Whatever one may
say about indirect taxes from the theoretical standpoint, the fact is that one
feels them less. It is hard for the individual to say how much he pays, how
much he shifts to his fellow citizens." Yet everyone knows exactly how much
income or class tax he pays. The resentment of the taxpayer would be less if
the burden were hidden rather than open.
While the poor man had no way to reduce the amount of his class tax, he
could, if indirect taxes were substituted for it, reduce his tax burden by consuming less tobacco, drinking less beer, or turning down his lamp in the evening. Indirect taxes and tariffs should be limited to ten to fifteen articles that
were massively consumed, yet not vital to life—the "luxury items of the great
masses," such as tobacco, coffee, sugar, petroleum, beer, and brandy. The
luxuries of the wealthy should be taxed very high, but little income could be
expected from them. Income taxes ought to be imposed only on the wealthi•° SBR (1875-1876), I, 28, 115-116.

est citizens, more as a "prestige" than a "finance tax." Taxes on real estate
were basically unjust, for they were confiscatory. If direct taxes could be levied
only by urban governments, the flight from the land would eventually cease.
The deputies, Bismarck continued, ought not to regard state assessments as
"a question of parliamentary power. The power of the Reichstag rests on law,
justice, and the constitution." Its right to grant or withhold taxes was secure.
If the deputies wished more power they should seek it within the states, not
the Reich, which was not yet strong enough to endure "tests of strength."
Contrary to what Richter demanded, a collegial cabinet was impossible for
the Reich; group responsibility was no responsibility at all; only one minister,
the chancellor, could be responsible. On the other hand, it was possible to
have imperial "ministries" of another kind: that is, separate departments directly under the control of the chancellor, an arrangement "corresponding to
that of an English prime minister." Some already existed—those for foreign
affairs, naval affairs, railway affairs, the post and telegraph; others were desirable, including one for Alsace-Lorraine.,2
To Richter Bismarck's discourse appeared to be nothing more than a
"harmless, uninhibited chat."13 The chancellor's physical condition seemed
to be more significant than his words; it was difficult to believe that a man in
his debilitated condition was actually announcing a major reversal in policy
that might require years to effect. Bismarck, however, had shot his first arrow
into the target. At his parliamentary soiree on December 11, he split it with
the shaft of a second. He had become, he told his startled guests, a zealous
advocate of nationalization of the German railways. The Kaiser was "greatly
interested" in the project;14 the Prussian cabinet had discussed it "academically," and none of the ministers was opposed in principle. A unified railway
system was as urgent and necessary as a unified postal service. It would be
administered by one of the new imperial "ministries," the need for which he
had justified to the Reichstag. A reorganization of the Reich executive would

taxes was not a sudden idea conceived in the late 1870s. On the contrary, he argued the advantages of indirect taxation in the research paper he wrote on political economy as a university
student preparing for the state examination and again in a speech of 1851 in the Prussian Chamber of Deputies. Horst Kohl, ed., Bismarck-)ahrbuch, II (1895), II, 2t-47, and BR, I, 207. He

As in the case of the protective tariff in 1876, the Kaiser brought the matter independently
to Bismarck's attention. Italy's conversion of its northern railways to state ownership suggested
to Wilhelm that the German government might well revive Heydt's proposal of the 1850s for a
publicly owned network. See his letter to Bismarck, Dec. 8, 1875, inFriedrichJungnickel, Staatsmiruster Albert von Maybach (Stuttgart, 1910), pp. 30-31.

create imperial "ministries" for commerce, customs, communications, finance, justice, and Alsace-Lorraine that would administer imperial affairs under the general responsibility of the chancellor. This time, however, he drew
a distinction between the English system and that which he proposed. The
authority of the English prime minister over the cabinet rested on his power
to force the resignation of ministers opposed to his policies; that of the chancellor, on his right to intervene in imperial agencies and make decisions "at
any stage." The heads of these bodies in other words, were not to be ministers
at all in the English sense. They were to be mere state secretaries acting under
the direction of the chancellor, the empire's only minister. "Naturally," he
concluded, "all of this will not be accomplished without a diminution of DeIbriick."1?
The news of these remarks reverberated through the German press and was
the subject of widespread speculation. Obviously Delbriick's days in office
were numbered, not only because he could not accept a reduced status but
also because he had to oppose on principle such a state-socialist scheme as
public ownership of the nation's railways.l6 But what would his departure in
this context mean for the future of the government's relations with the liberal
parties? The issue was unclear. With Delbriick's exit liberals would lose the
man who for two decades had done more than any other to promote liberal
causes within the government—low tariffs and free trade, liquidation of restraints on industrial capitalism, and growth of the imperial government at
the cost of the states. Yet the liberal deputies had since 1867 persistently
advocated establishment of imperial ministries and an imperial cabinet. Now
the chancellor was at least using their terminology, and, although his meaning was different, the reorganization he proposed could be seen as at least a
step toward ultimate realization of their aspirations. While a publicly owned
railway system would violate the principle of laissez-faire and was certain to
alarm some capitalists, it would be a step toward the unitary state, another
oft-proclaimed goal of many liberals and of extreme nationalists like
Treitschke.17 Eventually it might provide the imperial government with yet

shown by an entry in Bamberger's diary dated "end of November." "Bennigsen has just told me
something very notable. Standing in the Reichstag close to Delbriick, Bismarck had complained:
that Delbriick opposes him everywhere by his need to dominate, that he [Bismarck] would like
to provide the Reich with an organization composed of large, independent offices, such as we
want, but Delbriick is unwilling to give up anything. In saying these things, Bismarck uttered
such vehement comments about Delbruck that Bennigsen did not wish to repeat them—of all
Bismarck's fantasies full of suspicion they were the strongest!" Ernst Feder, ed., Bistnarcks grosses

another source of income beyond control of parliament and conceivably reduce those state assessments that had become for liberals the palladium of
parliamentary power over the purse. Ill or not, Bismarck had a great talent for
finding the issue with which simultaneously to advance his policy, mask its
direction, and create confusion and divisiveness among those affected by it.
For the time being Bismarck had to conceal his intentions. A premature
confrontation, or one based on the wrong issue, would consolidate the National Liberal party and cement its relationship with the progressives. Not
until the elections due in the winter of 1876-1877 was there any prospect of
altering the composition of the chamber. Hence Bismarck strove for months
to quell persistent rumors that his affection for "his friends of the majority
parties was no longer as warm as in earlier times."'8 In late November 1875
Bennigsen reported that Bismarck denied any desire for "conflict with us."19
At the soiree on December 18 he averred that he had no intention of turning
away from the national liberals, of conducting a "quiet war" against them
until the elections, or of trying to build a new party. "To be sure, it would be
alright with him if in the elections the so-called 'right wing' of the National
Liberal party and the free conservatives gained in strength. But he immediately went on to assure his listeners that he did not attribute much importance
to party differences." He would be satisfied if the same persons were reelected—that is, after they had learned from the voters that the public favored his policies. "He harbors great and far-reaching plans for the future
domestic policy of the Reich and in realizing them would not be able to dispense with the support of the Reichstag majority that had been loyal up to
now."20 A few days later he summoned the deputy Wilhelm Wehrenpfennig
to reinforce the point. "Everything that is being said about his desire to break
with the national liberals," Wehrenpfennig reported him as saying, "is idle
maliciousness and nonsense. He asserts that he is more than ever resolved to
depend upon them alone for support; they are the only possible political party,
etc."31
Naturally these blandishments were not reassuring to everyone, particularly
not to the party's left wing. "The thought of a reorganization of the liberal
party according to our point of view," Heinrich Oppenheim wrote to Lasker
on November 10, 1875, "is so prevalent that it constantly reappears—with
all kinds of references in the press to the affected persons. Miquel spoke with
me quite spontaneously about it and expressed most decisively the desire to
emancipate himself from Bismarck!"22 During most of 1875 Lasker had been
seriously ill of typhus, from which some thought he never fully recuperated.

But in late October he was back on station in the Reichstag,23 harried by the
feeling that time was running out for men of his conviction.24 On December
27 he caucused with three close associates (Ludwig Bamberger, Max von
Forckenbeck, and Baron Franz von Stauffenberg) to consider "steps toward
the development of the constitution." "Lasker," Bamberger wrote in his diary,
"wants to introduce a motion in the chamber that will forcefully [mit Gewalt]
bring the issue to a head and must lead to a clash with Bismarck. He asked
whether we were ready to go so far with him." All three shrank back from
such a confrontation. Bamberger was inclined to interpret the issue as personal. Animosity between Bismarck and Lasker, he wrote, had reached the
level of that earlier between Bismarck and Twesten. "They hate each other
openly. Lasker believes Bismarck is now very dispensable."25
Lasker was correct in sensing at the end of 1875 that the liberals had
reached the last crossing in their relations with Bismarck. As the economic
crisis continued, liberalism as an economic theory lost ground and with it
liberalism as a political ideology. The time was coming when those who
prided themselves on "committed liberalism" were to be on the defensive,
able only to react to Bismarck's initiatives and subject to the divisive manipulations by which he sought to reshape the structure of parliament to fit his
own authoritarian ends. Important members of the national liberal left,
which was presumed to hold the balance of power in German parliamentary
life, had grown accustomed to dealing with Bismarck and likewise to the periodic crises it involved. Among them was Forckenbeck, who, by virtue of his
general prestige as president of the Reichstag and lord mayor of Breslau (later
Berlin), was regarded as a logical candidate for the chancellorship and hence
essential to the success of any liberal revolt against Bismarck.26
Under the influence of Bismarck's charisma, Forckenbeck and his associates
were inclined to share the presumption of his indispensability. Since 1866
they had traveled a long and tortuous road from compromise to compromise,
which, despite the sacrifices it imposed, had achieved economic and national
objectives they valued. Most important of all, they were evidently inclined to
the belief that, although straws flew in the wind, no gale was in prospect.
Even if Bismarck were bent on a new policy, it was not certain that it would
be disadvantageous to the liberal cause or that by collaborating with him they
could not, as so often in the past, shape it somewhat to their own designs.
They were inclined to accept Bismarck's word that the National Liberal party
was still vital to his program, that he had no intention of striking bargains

with the Center party or of calling off the Kulturkampf, and that he could do
nothing with the conservatives "who, if restored to favor at court, would
merely conspire to bring about his fall."27
Delbruck's Fall
Indeed, there was concrete evidence for the accuracy of these assumptions.
Judged by actions as well as words, the Bismarck government seemed eager to
avoid alienating the national liberals during the German and Prussian legislative sessions of 1875-1876. The policy was evident in the debates on three
major issues: the imperial budget for 1876, the imperial penal code act, and
the plan for railway nationalization.
In the Reichstag debates on the budget during November 1875, both
Camphausen and Bismarck stressed the desire for harmonious relations with
parliament. The proposals for increasing the brewing tax and introducing a
new stamp tax on securities, they stressed, were not to be regarded as "cabinet
questions," involving the possibility of a dissolution. Camphausen actually
asserted that, if disagreement should develop between government and parliament, "then the men who lead the government must retire; others must take
their places; harmony must be reached."28 Camphausen's constitutional theory was startling, but even Bismarck tantalized the deputies with visions of
future power. If the Reichstag exercised its unchallenged right to refuse new
taxes, he declared, the government would simply come back again with other
proposals until either the ministers or the deputies changed their minds "or
other persons take over the tiller."29 In the budget committee Eugen Richter,
the parliament's keenest fiscal expert, whittled away until a new shape
emerged that the deputies avidly accepted. While rejecting new taxes and
preserving the state assessments at the previous level, he proposed to balance
the budget by ending certain fiscal practices that in recent years had enabled
the government to pile up treasury surpluses by underestimating the Reich's
income. But the Reichstag majority also rejected a number of new positions
for staff officers in the militia that were in excess of the iron budget. Then the
deputies waited to see how the government would take the news. To general
surprise Delbriick announced (December 16, 1875) that the amendments
would stand, although the Reichstag would have to assume responsibility for
any undesirable consequences in the budget for 1877.3°

From November 1875 to February 1876 the Reichstag and the press were
even more concerned about the contents of a government bill (StrafgesetTjwvelle) to amend extensively the penal code of 1870, one of the great achievements of the North German Confederation. Some proposed changes in the
code were political in character and a serious threat to civil liberties. In a
speech lasting two-and-a-half hours (December 3, 1875) Lasker excoriated
"rubber paragraphs" that could be stretched to include liberal critics as well
as ultramontane and socialist opponents of the government. Paragraphs
threatening to freedom of speech, assembly, and the press were struck out of
the statute by a coalition of national liberals, progressives, centrists, socialists, and other fragments. Among the excised clauses was a so-called "socialist
paragraph," which would have exposed to fine and imprisonment the organizers and members of secret societies and anyone threatening the public peace
by stimulating class conflict or attacking the institutions of marriage, family,
and property.31
In the debate on December 3, the progressive leader Albert Hanel openly
charged what many thought—that the bill had been deliberately designed to
cleave apart the two wings of the National Liberal party. Everyone expected
a harsh reaction to the liberal amendments.32 But again, to general astonishment, Bismarck shied away from conflict. His duty, he declared, was to request laws whether or not passage was likely. He wanted to open a dialogue
with parliament, between the parties in the parliament, and between the deputies and the voters. While the majority had the right to amend government
bills, it must not expect the issues to disappear. "Some worms don't die."33
He did insist, however, on some paragraphs, which finally passed when the
national liberals, after heated caucuses, deserted the opposition to join conservatives and free conservatives. Thus were passed: the "pulpit paragraph"
directed against ultramontane clerics who "endangered public peace" by discussing "affairs of state"; the "Duchesne paragraph" aimed at agitators who
impelled others to commit illegal acts; and the "Arnim paragraph" providing
for the imprisonment of diplomats guilty of communicating official information to unauthorized persons or of misleading their superiors with false or
distorted information. Although divided on the "pulpit paragraph," the National Liberal party remained intact. If the national liberals made compromises, so did Bismarck. The only issue he raised to the status of a cabinet
question was the "Arnim paragraph," to which they attributed little importance.34
Nationalization of the German railways was not a sudden decision for Bismarck. A frequent traveler and shipper of grain and timber, he was sensitive

to such matters as poor service and inequitable charges. During the Granderjahre he prodded his colleagues, particularly Minister of Commerce Itzenplitz,
to halt the abuse of government loan guarantees and to strengthen competition by preventing monopolistic mergers and concessioning parallel lines.35
By early 1873 he had reached the conclusion that "big corporate railway powers" could be brought under control only if the Prussian government constructed competing railways and bought the major lines radiating from Berlin,
the hub of the German railway system.36 For years he had also been distressed
by the failure to implement clauses in the imperial constitution granting the
Reich the power to regulate the nation's railways. He desired an imperial
agency equipped with strong regulatory authority, but the medium states resisted. Passage in the Bundesrat being doubtful, he turned to the Reichstag.
Apparently with the chancellor's connivance, the liberals produced a bill creating an Imperial Railway Office, which Bismarck pushed through the Bundesrat (June 1873).37 Nevertheless, other statutes were needed if the agency
was to have any effective authority over rates and services, and here again
Bismarck encountered frustration. Two presidents of the agency, Friedrich
Scheele and Albert Maybach, resigned in succession when they failed to obtain from the Bundesrat a regulatory statute. Behind the existing abuses stood
too many vested interests—both private and state-owned railway enterprises.
Since 1866 Bismarck had been of the conviction that an active railway
policy would pay big dividends in the consolidation of the Reich. In January
1870, at a moment when the movement for national unity was at a low ebb,
he wrote that use of the North German Confederation's regulatory power
would "strengthen national sympathies for confederate institutions. Every satisfaction of the public's wishes, every redress of widely shared grievances about
the operation of one or more railway lines, every improvement in service that
is attributed to the confederation will gain their thanks."38 After six years of
further frustration in his efforts to establish effective regulation, he concluded
that "the national idea" could best be served by imperial ownership. Sinews
of steel would bind the nation together.35 Railway profits and railway shares

or not shareholders would welcome nationalization was disputed. But there
was no doubt that both big landowners and big industrialists, the chief users
of railway freight transport, favored it. Like Bismarck, they deplored the multitude of freight rate schedules (no less than 1,357 m !875), the frequency
with which they were changed, and the "differential rates" that favored foreign shippers. A nationalized system might also eventually provide a new
source of imperial revenue with which to reduce the Reich's dependence upon
the state assessments subject to Reichstag approval.40 Bismarck expected both
economic and political dividends from this venture into state socialism. Here
again he was destined to disappointment.
In January 1876 the Prussian cabinet approved the sale of Prussian state
railways to the Reich, despite the reservations of Camphausen.41 In May the
bill passed the Prussian Chamber of Deputies, where it was opposed by centrists as a danger to federalism and by progressives as a threat to the freeenterprise system. Richter feared the concentration of economic power that
would result from a "Bismarck railway" and its possible consequences for parliamentary power over the budget.42 In the House of Lords ultraconservatives
unsuccessfully opposed the measure as a sacrifice of Prussian autonomy.
Weeks before the statute was enacted, however, it was already evident that
the medium states were unwilling to match Prussia's sacrifice. Although Prussian national liberals (Lasker in the lead) favored nationalization, most party
colleagues from the medium states were violently opposed, as were many free
conservatives from the same regions.43 So also were their governments. Saxony, Bavaria, Wurttemberg, and Baden objected to loss of control over their
own state and private railways and to the concentration of economic and
social power that a nationalized system would bring to the Reich.44
Although the prospect for full nationalization was slim, Bismarck was determined to execute at least the decision of the Prussian cabinet and Landtag
to offer Prussia's state-owned railways to the Reich. But even this was denied
him. The Prussian ministries of finance and commerce could not agree on
terms to be presented to the Bundesrat and Reichstag. Month after month,
40
Conservatives had already begun to promote publicly the idea of nationalization—Count
Udo zu Stolberg in the Prussian House of Lords on Mar. 19, 1875, and Karl Stumm and Wilhelm
von Kardorff in the Reichstag on Nov. 24, 1875. SBHH (1875), I, 200; SBR (1875-1876), I,

who had been appointed president of the Imperial Railway Office, proposed nationalization to
Bismarck on Oct. 4, 1875. On Oct. 23, 1875, he reported to Bismarck that the proposal was
financially "feasible." Annual surpluses and "savings" of about 206,480,000 marks produced by
Germany's railways would suffice to float at 5.81 percent bonds worth 3,530,000,000 marks to
defray the purchase. Jungmckel, Maybach, pp. 30-31, 50-52.

the impasse between ministers Camphausen and Achenbach continued,
while Bismarck fumed, unable even to get a clear picture of the status of the
discussion.45 In March 1878 he described the situation to the Chamber of
Deputies. "I had the agreement in principle of my colleagues; I had the agreement in principle of the entire Landtag; and yet, although minister-president,
I found myself absolutely unable to bring the matter one step further along.
Agreement does not help me at all when passive resistance—from what direction in this complicated machine is impossible to learn—is conducted with
such success that I am scarcely in a position after two to three years to answer
even the most basic questions. The Prussian cabinet has never even reached
the point of discussing the question of how Prussia is formally to offer its railways to the Reich—and presumably be refused. Nor has the cabinet discussed
with the Ministry of Finance the evaluation of Prussia's rail properties and the
price that could be asked from the Reich."46 Privately Bismarck concluded
that Camphausen was the actual obstructionist. "The bankers, with whom he
is befriended, would never have pardoned him."47
For all its frustrations the nationalization proposal may have helped extract
at least one thorn from Bismarck's flesh. On April 25, 1876, one day before
the crucial debate on it in the Chamber of Deputies, the news broke that
Rudolf Delbriick had resigned—on grounds of poor health. Only Bismarck
had played a greater public role in the early years of the German Reich. The
chancellor's long absences from Berlin had heightened Delbruck's importance. In the press, Reichstag, and Bundesrat his departure was lamented as
a great loss to the orderly operation of government. Naturally there was widespread speculation about the actual reason for his retirement. Had he disagreed with the nationalization scheme? Was the Bismarck government veering away from the free-trade and free-enterprise policies with which Delbriick
was so closely identified? Was this the beginning of a purge of liberals from
high office? Bismarck was quick to deny everything. For nearly a year he had
pushed and shoved in the effort to unseat Delbriick. But now he delivered in
the Reichstag a glowing eulogy. "Not a shadow of a difference of opinion
concerning any of the pending questions of the day has appeared between him
and his majesty, between him and me."48
Attacks by Ultraconservatives
During 1876-1877 Bismarck steadily advanced his pieces on the chessboard
of German politics, pulling back his knights and rooks from exposed positions
only to redeploy them later in other directions. Despite disturbing signs, the

national liberals felt reassured when successive crises were surmounted without a serious break with the government. Once again they had succeeded in
leaving their imprint on critical legislation. Rumors spread of attempts by
ultramontanes to negotiate with Bismarck; yet there was no apparent relaxation of the chancellor's determination to pursue the Kulturkampf. Although
Delbriick had departed, the liberal ministers FaIk and Camphausen remained
in office. The depression continued, and agitation for protectionism grew; yet
the government's position on free trade appeared unchanged. Equally lulling
was the fact that Bismarck's personal relations with the ultraconservatives,
instead of improving as seemed possible during deliberations on the May laws
of 1875, appeared to deteriorate.
Earlier it has been shown that the indemnity act of 1866, the Hanoverian
provincial fund of 1868, the school inspection and county reform acts of
1872, and the appointment of new peers in 1872 were successive wedges that
widened the gap between Bismarck and the ultraconservatives and split the
conservative movement into pro- and antigovernment factions in the Prussian Landtag.49 In September 1872 the ultras came into control of the principal mouthpiece of conservative interests, the Kreuzzeitung. The newspaper
founded and long edited by Hermann Wagener, to whose columns Bismarck
himself had once contributed and which had vigorously supported his policies
in the constitutional conflict, was now in the hands of a hostile editor, Nathusius Ludom. Through the "era articles" Nathusius hoped to "cause a sensation" that would win over to the ultra cause "agrarians and others" who had
sided with the government on the Kulturkampf. But moderate conservatives
like Moritz von Blanckenburg, who had been seeking a reunion of conservative factions on an agrarian program, were "astounded" that the Kreuzzeitung
had resorted to libel.50 Bismarck's first thought was to prosecute, but the articles had been composed with a careful eye on the laws against libel. Neither
he nor Heinrich von Friedberg, chief of the Imperial Office of Justice, could
find adequate grounds for suit.51 Instead, the chancellor denounced the "reptile press" in the Reichstag during the debate on the Strafgesetznovelh (February 9, 1876). "Everyone who receives and pays for [the Kreuzzeitung] shares
indirectly in the lies and slander that are published in it, in slanders such as
the Kreuzzeitung contained last summer against the highest officials of the
Reich, without the slightest hint of proof."52 But this attempt to destroy the
newspaper by alienating its readership backfired. Beginning on February 26,
hundreds of conservative readers signed a "declaration" supporting the Kreuzzeitung and ostentatiously renewed their subscriptions. Among them were
some of Bismarck's oldest acquaintances, including Adolf von Thadden, the

owner of Trieglaff where Bismarck had first met Marie von Thadden and Moritz von Blanckenburg. Whatever sympathy Bismarck may have gained in the
reaction against the "era articles" he lost in the attempt to crush the Kreuzzeitung. Even Blanckenburg, who was not a signer, evidently felt that he had
reached a turning point in his relationship with the chancellor. One evening
he pulled out of his desk letters received from Bismarck over a period of forty
years, and, after reading passages to Roon, tossed them one by one into the
blazing hearth. 53
As noted earlier, the Perrot articles were but one of several attempts by
conservatives and muckraking journalists to discredit liberal ministers and in­
criminate Bismarck personally in financial scandals.54 Even as Bismarck con­
sidered his change of course in domestic policy at Varzin, two Pomeranian
neighbors, Ludwig von Wedemeyer and Otto von Diest-Daber, were plotting
to do him serious injury. At Diest-Daber's suggestion Wedemeyer wrote a
pamphlet insinuating that Bismarck had received a "gratuity" (his profit from
speculation in Boderi'Credit shares reserved for him at the issuing price) in
return for his assistance in gaining special privileges for the company. They
intended to distribute fifteen thousand copies of the document to landowners,
but the unstable Wedemeyer committed suicide (November 25, 1875), and it
was not until September 1876 that the brochure appeared in an abbreviated
form edited by Diest-Daber. On October 6 the Kreuzzeitung reported that the
first printing was already exhausted, and a second was in preparation.55 The
charges of Wedemeyer and Diest, like those of Perrot and Nathusius, were so
cleverly phrased that the state's attorney could find no grounds for suit under
the libel laws. The editors of Die deutsche Reicfisglocice, a weekly journal, with

head to toe." On Bismarck's order the entire list of Deklaranten was published in the official
Staatsanzeiger in order to show that he had indeed broken ("cut the tablecloth") with the signers.

weekly Sozicdpolitische Konespondenz, came to the prosecutor's assistance by
deliberately repeating the insinuations in a form that made them, and ultimately Diest-Daber as well, vulnerable to indictment.56 As previously described, the result was a series of trials in January-February 1877 that, while
they vindicated Bismarck, revealed the depths of the bitterness that now divided the chancellor from the ultras and their journalistic allies. What his
detractors published had long been bruited in the aristocratic clubs of Berlin. 57
Bismarck never fully recovered from the wounds inflicted by his fellow aristocrats in the mid-i870S. In dictating his memoirs in the 1890s, he tried again
to categorize those who had opposed him and dissect their motives. Many
readers of the Kreuzzeitung, he declared, were motivated by principles that
outweighed their Prussian and German national feeling, but some, of whom
Harry von Arnim was a prototype, opposed him out of personal ambition.
Members of his own caste (Standesgenossen) among the landed nobility, on
the other hand, were personally envious that his career had elevated him
above them. "That I advanced from Landjunker to minister they would have
been able [to] forgive, but not the dotations and not the princely title that
was accorded me much against my will." The predicate ExceUenz was within
the limits of what was customarily attainable, but the predicate Durchhucht
"aroused criticism." It was, furthermore, in the nature of politics, as in religion, for men to deny validity to the convictions of others and to identify
their own cause with the public welfare. "My political convictions are right
and yours false; my belief is pleasing to God and your unbelief leads to damnation." Self-righteousness led men in the political struggle to commit acts
that in their private lives they would regard as improper and unjust.
"After they had joined in Perrot's disgraceful attacks on my honor, there
was no longer any possibility of a personal relationship between me and the
Deklaranten, many of whom had until then been acquaintances, even friends.
Suddenly to break off contact with all or almost all friends and acquaintances
is a hard test for the nerves of a man of mature years. At that time my health
had long been weakened, not by the work that burdened me, but by the continuing awareness of my responsibility for major events in which the future of
the fatherland was at stake." Statesmen can never know for sure whether the
course they set is correct; yet they are compelled to make decisions and to act
on those decisions, often over the opposition of those whom one is accus56

was represented by an unsigned and anonymous statement read by the state's attorney, which
denied Diest-Daber's charges. The court permitted the statement to be read after the conclusion
of the proceedings, but before the judges rendered their decision, on the word of the state's
attorney "that he had been authorized to read it by a high personage [von hoher SteUe] and that
he vouched for the authenticity of the contents." Diest-Daber, Zur Klarsteilung.

tomed to take seriously. "The source of the problem is not work but doubt
and concern," and the necessity of making grave decisions in times of crisis
without anything to fall back upon but one's own conviction and willpower.
"Intercourse with others whom one regards as equals makes easier the mastery
of such crises," but, when the responsible minister suddenly finds himself boycotted and treated as an enemy by his former friends, for motives that are
more personal and ignoble than objective and honorable, the consequence
was damaged nerves and shattered health. One would have thought, he continued, that "the national party," in whose behalf he had incurred the wrath
of former conservative party comrades, would have sprung to his defense and
made clear that they did not share the views of the libelers. But the national
liberals only seemed to take satisfaction in the quarrel and to want to intensify
it. "Liberals and conservatives were united (each in behalf of their own partisan interests) in their determination to exhaust me, discard me, and attack
me."' 8
By the late 1870s Bismarck—the unifier of Germany, minister-president of
Prussia and chancellor of the German Reich, the dominant figure in German
and European politics—thought of himself as deserted, libeled, and slandered
by foes and former friends alike. He felt isolated and unappreciated (except
by his immediate family) because he had pursued with single-minded determination, without fear or favor, the objective interests of the Prussian and
German state.

Birth of the German Conservative Party
In February and March 1876 the KreuzzeitungOeklaranten affair appeared to
widen the following of ultraconservatives among the Prussian gentry. While
some deplored Perrot's attack on personalities, the long list of Dekhranten
showed that the gentry shared the Kreuzzeitung's hostility toward the government's economic policies and its favoritism toward the interests of industrial
capitalism. Nevertheless, the ultimate effect of the affair was to accelerate a
movement for conservative renewal already under way. In the winter elections of 1873-1874 all conservative factions, ultras as well as moderates, had
suffered disaster at the polls. Obviously the cost of the quarrel with Bismarck
and of divisiveness within the conservative movement was considerable. But
it was also apparent that the Prussian, particularistic, reactionary image that
the conservatives projected limited their effectiveness with the voters. To
prosper under universal male suffrage, it seemed, the conservatives had to
enlarge their geographical and social radius by becoming a national party representing national interests. Even ultras were now willing to yield to tactical
necessity. In 1876 the approach of new elections made action imperative.

Months of correspondence and two preliminary caucuses by prominent
conservatives in Berlin and Frankfurt am Main led in July to establishment of
the "German Conservative party" and publication of an election manifesto,
which served as a program until 1892. Issued by Otto von Helldorff-Bedra, a
leader of the "Stahl faction" in the Prussian House of Lords, the manifesto
was signed by twenty-seven prominent conservatives—thirteen from Prussia,
five from Bavaria, and three each from Saxony, Baden, and Hesse. The new
program and party have often been credited by historians with having converted the conservative movement: from a Prussian-particularistic to a German national basis; from an ideological to an agrarian basis; and from an oppositional to a progovernment party.59 Actually the achievement of 1876 was
not so spectacular. What the new party and program represented was not the
sudden conversion of the conservative movement, but the final and decisive
stage in its reorganization under a program fashioned by moderates at the cost
of ultras. What had begun with the founding of the Free Conservative party
in 1867 and continued with the founding in 1872 of the Monarchical-National party of the Reichstag and the New Conservative party of the Prussian
Chamber of Deputies reached fruition in the German Conservative party of
1876. That the German conservatives became a pro-Bismarck party was owed
as much to his turn to the right as their turn to the left.
In the first paragraph of the manifesto Helldorff and associates declared
their intent to work "in a national sense" to strengthen German unity on the
basis of the imperial constitution. Yet this was not a new posture for moderate
conservatives. In their program of 1872 Reichstag conservatives had used the
title "national" and stressed their desire to work "hand in hand" with the
government in promoting "German interests." Even the New Conservative
party of the Prussian Chamber of Deputies stressed that its "basic view" was
national, as well as monarchical and conservative, and pledged "to support
with complete dedication the policy through which Germany has attained
unity, power, and freedom." Yet the Prussianism of the conservatives was by
no means dead. It lived on under the guise of federalism. In 1876, as in 18721873, the conservatives stressed their opposition to the unitary state and their
desire to preserve "the justified independence and character of the individual
states, provinces, and peoples [Stamme]."60
The attempt of the German Conservative party to widen its geographical
representation was largely a failure. Like its predecessors, the party continued
to be identified with Prussia and the Prussian establishment until its demise

in 1918. Although the program of 1876 denounced the Kulturkampf as a
"misfortune for Reich and people," the party never succeeded in enticing
Catholic conservatives away from the Center party. Hanoverian Guelphs,
though conservative in social and political outlook, voted either for centrists
or for deputies who joined the "Hanoverian-German" caucus in parliament.
Free conservatives maintained their separate party and retained the support
of their constituents in Silesia. In southern and western Germany conservatives who did not vote for centrists supported the right wing of the National
Liberal party. Outside Prussia the German Conservative party gained the loyalty of only small groups of voters in Saxony and Mecklenburg. It remained
essentially an east-Elbian, Lutheran, and rural party. While adopting publicly
a more positive attitude toward the Reich, its voters and deputies remained
essentially Prussian in outlook and loyalty. From one-half to two-thirds of the
party's Reichstag delegation were noblemen. Heavily represented in its ranks
were big landowners, former army officers, and Prussian officials.61
It is also inaccurate to attribute to the new party and program of 1876 the
sudden transformation of conservatism from an ideological to an agrarian program. Before and after 1876 the party never ceased to place "decisive weight
on the monarchical foundations of our state and a strong authoritarian
power." While confessing the need to do justice to the "needs of the present,"
the manifesto of 1876 stated that new legislation must be based on "real and
historically established foundations," thereby "securing the continuity of our
entire political, social, and spiritual development." The document called for
"civil liberties for all" and for "an effective participation by the nation in
legislation," yet avoided an endorsement of universal male suffrage in national elections and advocated "self-administration in province, county, and
community based not on universal male suffrage but on the natural groups
and organic divisions of the people." It recognized the right of the state to
regulate church-state relationships but defended the internal autonomy of
both Catholic and Protestant churches. The "confessional Christian grammar
school" was termed "the most important barrier" to social chaos.62 The ideology of "throne and altar" and the organic view of society remained alive in
the thought and politics of Prussian conservatism. Still, the program represented a shift away from the patently worn-out feudal corporatism of ultras
like Ludwig Gerlach and Count Lippe.
Agrarianism was hardly new in conservative politics. Since its inception
the Prussian Conservative party had never failed to defend agrarian interests
wherever they came into conflict with capitalism and industrialism. Yet it is
true that the concern of conservative leaders over the "excesses of capitalism"
and over the increasing weight of industry as against agriculture in the Ger61

Salomon, Parteiprogramme, II, 7-0.

+ Transition in Domestic Policy +

343

man economy increased in the mid-1870s. That concern was a primary impulse behind the decision to found a new party and draft a new program.
"Here nothing whatever can be accomplished with a conservative program
and a conservative agitation," wrote Baron von Mirbach-Sorquitten to KleistRetzow in early July 1876, "but only by moving forward in the sense of the
agrarians."63 Naturally landowners participated in the growing disillusionment with liberal economics and the free-enterprise system after the crash of
1873. The manifesto of 1876 called for "an ordered economic freedom" in
contrast to the "unlimited freedom of liberal theory." It demanded the "stepby-step abolition of the privileges of big capital" and an end to the "severe
damage" inflicted by excessive economic concentration and by the lack of
"firm regulations for agriculture and small manufacturing. We demand especially the revision of the industrial code and of the poor law [{Jnterstutzungswohnsitz] in accord with experience." Unrestrained individualism could not
lead to "sound economic development"; the honest man had to be protected
against speculators.6+
For Hermann Wagener the manifesto of 1876 was a disappointment. During the early 1870s he had worked with Rudolph Meyer, editor of the conservative Berliner Revue, and Johann Karl von Rodbertus, a Pomeranian landowner and publicist, in agitating for a "social conservative" party capable of
forging an alliance between agrarians and proletarians. In 1872 Wagener had
a hand in the drafting of the program of the Reichstag's Monarchical-National party, to which the new conservatives adhered in 1873.65 His influence
can be seen in the program's focus on the interests of proletarians rather than
artisans, its assertion that for a healthy development the German Reich must
meet the needs and justified demands of the masses, and its insistence that
the social question could only be solved by "the strong arm" of an authoritarian government. The state must foster institutions and corporative bodies
"suitable for securing and furthering the material and spiritual position of the
workers' estate" and create agencies for the arbitration of conflicts between
employers and employees.66 Yet Wagener did not succeed in introducing the
word "social" into the party title. His disgrace in 1873 left him in no position
to influence the manifesto in 1876, which contained only faint echoes of
these clauses. While the German Conservative party largely abandoned the
traditional quixotic interest of the conservatives in protecting artisans and
reconstructing guilds, it made no serious attempt to expand its political influence by taking up the cause of factory workers. Wagener and other conservative social thinkers persisted, moreover, in thinking of proletarians as an es63

tate (Stand) rather than a class and in seeking a solution to their problems in
terms of an updated corporatism.
Naturally Bismarck was deeply interested in attempts to unite and reconstitute the conservative movement. From a letter of Blanckenburg to KleistRetzow of August 1872 we know that he "edited sentence by sentence" the
program of 1872 and "discussed it in detail with Wagener."67 Yet he had no
part in drafting the program of 1876. That prominent ultras like Kleist-Retzow stayed out of sight during the preliminary discussions68 led him to hope
that a united, progovernment party was in prospect. But he was thoroughly
disillusioned when the full membership list was published in mid-July. It included Nathusius Ludom and so many Deidaranten that the new party appeared to be merely the "old feudal party of the Kreuzzeitung" in disguise.69
On July 18, 1876, Bismarck warned his brother Bernhard against letting the
New Conservative party, of which the latter was chairman, be absorbed by
the German conservatives. It was not to be expected, he wrote, that the Dekhranten had changed their views. If the party was to be dominated by Kreuzzeitung conservatives, then the government, as in 1872, would be forced to
move more to the left in order to gain support against the right. Barring some
"compelling need," Bernhard should not join and should advise associates
against sailing "under the flag of Nathusius Ludom and his political friends."70
For many months Bismarck held the German Conservative party at arm's
length. In late July 1876 the official Provinzial-Korrespondenz announced that
the government had nothing in common with the new party, and national
liberal deputy Georg Jung, who visited the chancellor at Bad Kissingen, reported him as saying that he would not be able to go along with the German
conservatives, because they were headed by men whose views on the Kulturkampf would cost him the services of FaIk.7' In early August the Norddeutsche
AUgemeine Zeitung and other journals reputed to be "semiofficial" mounted a
lively campaign in support of the new party, but perhaps not at Bismarck's
instigation. Since the war-in-sight crisis of 1875 he had loosened his contacts
with the Norddeutsche AUgemeine and reduced somewhat his attempts to influence the press—or so he said.72 In the November elections the new conservatives ran as a separate party, seemingly in accord with Bismarck's advice to

servative party was evident in February 1877, when he reacted strongly to an
interpellation by its caucus in the House of Lords concerning the Guelph
fund. Bismarck consulted with his colleagues in the cabinet on how to reply
as roughly as possible, yet without inflicting injuries. Two days later the
prince was still bent on having it out with the German conservatives. "The
incivilities that he had thought out burdened his stomach; he had to get rid
of them." But finally he handed the task over to Tiedemann, much to the
disappointment of centrists and national liberals, who crowded the galleries
in the hope of witnessing more friction between the government and the conservatives. "
In September 1877 Bismarck was still inclined to demand the expulsion of
the Deldaranten as the price of a closer relationship between himself and the
German conservatives.74 By that time, however, his need of the party's support outweighed, while it did not expunge, the hatred he felt toward those
whom he believed had betrayed him and stabbed him in the back. Bismarck
and the German conservatives came to terms with one another during 18761877 not out of love but mutual need. Their collaboration during the next
decade was dictated by the coincidence of mutual interests: a new parliamentary majority; a strengthened imperial government; a reduction in the power
of parliament; and a new economic policy favorable to agriculture. Even so it
was not until 18 79-1881 that the De/claranten became reconciled to the chancellor, establishing an uneasy truce that collapsed at the end of the decade.75

Parting of the Progressives and National Liberals
Despite the divorce of 1867 the progressives and national liberals continued
to think of themselves as but two caucuses of a common liberal party based
on the same general Weltanschauung. While the two caucuses had often differed on crucial issues such as the iron budget and civil rights, they never
ceased to collaborate in other significant areas of legislation such as the unifying statutes, economic legislation, and the Kulturkampf. On the local level
the common liberal party continued to exist in the committees and associations that picked liberal candidates for parliament. Only in larger cities did

progressives and national liberals nominate rival candidates at election
time.70
During 1876 liberals began to detect attempts by the Bismarck government, particularly by Eulenburg, to dissolve the relationship. The conservative press, Provinzial-Korrespondenz, and the Narddeutsche AUgemeine Zeitung,
which continued to be regarded as "semiofficial" despite Bismarck's disclaimers, openly agitated for the demolition of the liberal majority in Reichstag and
Landtag in the coming elections. In June one of Eulenburg's subordinates,
Landrat Hermann von Knobloch, dispatched a circular urging fellow Landrdte
to work for the election of a "Bismarck party" composed of conservatives and
national liberals ("particularly if the candidate happens to be a landowner").
Eulenburg expressed it bluntly in a speech to the Chamber of Deputies: "We
fight the Progressive party and, if it were possible to repress that party and put
the National Liberal party on its own feet, then we would be satisfied."77
In June 1876, nevertheless, the two caucuses held together in forcing the
defeat of Eulenburg's urban government bill in the reactionary form given it
by the House of Lords. In August the Nationalzeitung declared that the National Liberal party, for which it generally spoke, would never enter a "conservative-liberal governmental majority" as long as ministers were chosen
without regard to the views of the parliamentary majority and as long as the
nation's leading statesman raised the threat of reaction whenever the majority
insisted on liberal principles inconsonant with what he was willing to permit
for his own purposes.78 As the election campaign got under way in September,
Eugen Richter asserted that the government's attempt to split the National
Liberal party and destroy the progressives had only brought the two caucuses
closer together. Bismarck's purpose, he recognized, was to strengthen the conservatives and weaken the liberals, producing a parliamentary balance subject
to the chancellor's control. Again there was talk of reuniting the two caucuses
in order to produce a "firm liberal party capable of governing," but Richter
concluded that it was better to march in two columns.79
Although the liberal parties preserved their traditional united front during
the Prussian election campaign ending on October 27, 1876, each lost 5 seats,
the progressives shrinking from 68 to 63 seats, the national liberals from 174
to 169. The conservatives gained eleven seats (from 30 to 41), while the free
conservatives remained constant at 35 seats. Prussian voters appeared relatively constant in their loyalties, despite mounting pressures from the government, conservatives, and economic interest groups.80 The first of the blows

that was to cleave apart the liberal movement came neither from the voters
nor from the government, but from within the ranks of the Reichstag liberals.
As the economic depression dragged on and the degree of their vulnerability
on economic policy widened, the progressives and national liberals parted
company once more over the issue that had plagued the liberal movement
practically from its inception—that of freedom versus unity.
When the Reichstag met in early November 1876, an ugly dispute erupted
between the two liberal parties over the election of the chamber's presiding
officers.81 Yet this was but a prelude to the conflict that arose in mid-December over amendments to statutes establishing a common judiciary and imperial codes of civil and criminal procedure. Bismarck had long believed that
unity in law and justice would contribute greatly to the consolidation of the
Reich,82 a conviction shared by most liberals. Since 1869 Lasker and Miquel,
to whom a common system of law and justice were a precondition for the
durability of the Reich and second only to common language as a builder of
national sentiment, had repeatedly sponsored Reichstag bills extending the
legislative competence of the Reich to include civil and criminal justice.83 In
1873 they finally succeeded when a constitutional amendment was passed
over the opposition of centrists and particularists in the Reichstag and of Saxony, Wurttemberg, and Bavaria in the Bundesrat. Although the civil code
was not achieved until 1897, the statutes on judicial organization and the
codes of civil and criminal procedure reached the floor of the Reichstag in
November 1876. For two years these drafts had already been subjected to intense and often heated debate within the government, Bundesrat, and a special committee on the judiciary (Reicfojustizkommission) created by the
Reichstag.84
Many points at issue were purely technical in nature, but some were loaded
with political significance. In the committee and in the Reichstag the progressives and national liberals stood firmly together for amendments that: (1)
81
Forckenbeck and Stauffenberg (both national liberals) were reelected first and second presidents (speakers) of the Reichstag. But the national liberal caucus refused to support the reelection of Hanel (progressive) as third president, voting instead for Wilhelm Lowe, defector from
the progressives. Lowe refused to serve, and the national liberals finally accepted Hanel. The
incident left resentments among the progressives, the political consequences of which were soon
evident on other issues. SEG (1876), p. 94; Dill, Lasker pp. i5iff.

price for yielding;—exemption of Bavarian courts from the jurisdiction of the Reich Supreme
Court. The medium and small states got their revenge on Feb. 28, 1877, when they majoritized
Prussia—and Bismarck—for the first time by voting 30 to 28, to locate the Supreme Court in
Leipzig instead of Berlin.

specified jury trials in cases dealing with the press; (2) abolished the requirement that journalists and publishers reveal their sources of information; (3)
severely limited the right of the government to open mail; (4) provided that
officials who violated the law and the rights of citizens be tried in ordinary
rather than administrative courts; and (5) gave to the Reich Supreme Court
the power of decision in jurisdictional disputes between administrative and
regular courts.85 In view of his difficulties with the Catholic, conservative,
and muckraking press, Bismarck was sensitive on the first two points. But the
last three threatened prerogatives of the Prussian police state that had permitted authoritarian rule by the Manteuffel government in the 1850s and by
the Bismarck government during 1862—1866. The government's draft, on the
other hand, threatened to take away liberties already enjoyed in southern
states. InJuIy 1875 Bismarck instructed Delbriick to make absolutely sure that
no concessions or commitments were made by any representative of the government in the deliberations of the special committee on the judiciary. At
the end of November 1876 he returned from Varzin to Berlin prepared to
accept failure of the judicial reform "for the time being" rather than yield
what the liberals demanded.86
Nothing in the prior history of the National Liberal party, however, justified the assumption that it would, in the name of principle, sacrifice statutes
it regarded as vital for the completion of German unity. Before leaving Varzin
Bismarck received from Tiedemann an accurate appraisal of the situation.
The liberal majority, Tiedemann predicted, would stand fast during the second reading of the bills. Not even the right wing of the national liberals would
have the courage to capitulate too easily on such an issue immediately before
the Reichstag election due on January 10, 1877. But on the third reading
these men, "just as careful as they are brave," would reverse themselves if the
government stood firm. Their tactic was obvious. They wanted to be able to
tell the voters, "We fought like lions to the last second for liberal principles;
only when we saw that, owing to the stubbornness of the government, the
entire reorganization of the judiciary would fail unless we gave way, did we
sacrifice with bleeding hearts some liberal postulates. Only the coercive situation in which we found ourselves is to blame."87
Tiedemann's scenario was accurate. On December 2, the second reading
was completed with the important amendments still intact.88 On December
12, Bismarck exercised for the first time in years his prerogative of presiding
over the Bundesrat, which rejected eighteen amendments, including the "political" ones. The government, Bismarck told Bennigsen, had given in on a
hundred points; now it was the Reichstag's time to yield. Three days later the

"fathers of compromise"—Miquel, Bennigsen, and Lasker—negotiated with
Bismarck and Prussian Minister of Justice Leonhardt an agreement in which
the government yielded little and the Reichstag much.8» In the third reading
on December 18-21, the national liberals joined conservatives and free conservatives in passing the new version over the bitter opposition of progressives, centrists, and social democrats. August Bebel denounced the bill as a
"surrender of the people's rights," while the progressive spokesman Saucken
charged that the national liberals had lost their independence—they had become a government party. 9° As in 1866 and 1871, national liberals eased their
consciences by arguing that half of a loaf was better than none, that the
achievement of national unity in such a vital area as the judiciary was worth
the sacrifice of liberties that Prussian liberals had vainly struggled for most of
the century to gain.
Because of his strategic position in parliament, Lasker alone could have put
together a majority to defeat the bill. Instead, he was an impassioned defender
of the compromise. Since 1867 Lasker, a Prussian judge, had pushed relentlessly for the establishment of unity in law and justice. Now he praised what
had been attained as a great gain "in a national sense" for liberty as well as for
unity. He described himself in Bismarckian terms as a realist who in 1876, as
in 1867 and 1871, was willing to accept the better, which was achievable,
rather than insist on the best, which was not. In the air was a strong odor of
suspicion that the liberal era was about to end and a feeling that this last major
legislation must be achieved before the door was shut. Both Lasker and Miquel believed that the public as a whole was uninterested in the issues posed
by the political amendments.91 "I become more and more convinced," wrote
Miquel, "that we can lose all support among the people by excessive insistence on principles."92
To the progressives, on the other hand, the compromise was yet another
spineless capitulation on the part of politicians who lacked confidence in the
voters, whose liberties they needlessly bargained away. Leading the progressive attack on the compromise were Eugen Richter and Albert Hanel. Both
were of the opinion that the National Liberal party had by successive compromises "steadily lost the capacity to achieve liberal demands against the
government."93 The death of Hoverbeck in 1875 and the defection of WiIhelm Lowe in 1874 had thinned the ranks of the moderates in the Progressive

party, leaving the more aggressive Hanel and Richter as its principal spokesmen. Neither was inclined to tolerate any more "betrayals" of liberalism. In
the election campaign that ended on January 10, 1877, progressives and national liberals ceased to cooperate for the first time since 1867. In fact, they
fought each other as aggressively as they did conservatives, centrists, and social democrats. National liberals campaigned on their record of practical
achievement during the era of collaboration with Bismarck, but denied that
they had become a "government party." Progressives, on the other hand,
prided themselves on being the only liberal party that had stood by its principles. Successive compromises, they declared, had seriously injured the
Reichstag's prestige and led the government to count on its weakness. For the
first time the progressives unequivocally called for parliamentary government—"a Reich cabinet politically and legally responsible to the Reichstag
for the course of legislation and administration."94
Both liberal parties suffered on January 10. The national liberals lost 27
seats (155 to 128), the progressives 14 (49 to 35), while the new German
Conservative party enjoyed its first triumph by winning 18 new seats (22 to
40). Other parties made minimal gains: the center 2 seats (91 to 93), free
conservatives 2 (36 to 38), the social democrats 3 (9 to 12). Together the two
liberal caucuses (163 out of 397 seats) could no longer control a majority even
if they had been in a mood to cooperate.95 The Lasker wing of the National
Liberal party had lost, and was never again to regain, the pivotal position it
had putatively enjoyed, but which Lasker had been either unable or unwilling
to exploit. Even before Bismarck inflicted his first real blow, the liberal phalanx had begun to dissolve.
As so often in the past, the German liberals were in an unenviable situation. The necessity of working under a semiauthoritarian governmental system headed by a highly effective, autocratic statesman and staffed by a functioning bureaucracy compelled them to make one of two choices: either to
cooperate as political realists and thereby, for the sake of gains in the area of
national unity and centralization, run the risk of opportunism and loss of ideology; or to adhere rigidly to principle regardless of the cost and run the risk
of doctrinairism and political impotence. Neither course was attractive. For
progressives the only possible escape would have been the development of a
large popular following capable ultimately of forcing, by sheer numbers and
perennial persistence, the democratization of the system. But the election of
1877 confirmed once more that neither the social foundation nor the political
conviction existed for the achievement of such a goal. Left-liberals had no
prospect of conquering the liberal movement as a whole, and they lacked,
despite Schulze-Delitzsch, the social comprehension and political imagina*> SEG (1876), pp. 222-231.

351

tion that would have enabled them to enlarge their base of support and voter
appeal by bringing into the liberal camp the new legions of factory workers
crowding the industrial towns of Saxony, Silesia, and the Ruhr.
Progress of the Transition
By January 1877 Bismarck had made some progress in implementing the plans
formed at Varzin in 1875. Delbruck had been maneuvered out of office and
his replacement as chief of the chancellor's office, Karl von Hofmann, had
begun to reorganize the Reich executive according to Bismarck's wishes. On
January 1, 1877, two divisions of the chancellor's office became separate
bureaus headed by state secretaries directly under the chancellor's authority:
the Imperial Office of Justice and the Imperial Chancellery for Alsace-Lorraine. As independent agencies, these bodies were not parallel to the foreign
office, the admiralty, the railway office, and the chancellor's office itself. The
latter now functioned as a kind of "imperial ministry for trade and finance,"9*
since these were the only functions remaining to it. The liquidation of DeIbriick's old position as de facto vice-chancellor increased the personal authority of Bismarck, to whom the heads of the various parallel Reich agencies were
now directly subordinate.
Bismarck also heightened his influence within the Prussian cabinet by securing the appointment of Hofmann and Bernhard von Bulow (state secretary
of the Imperial Foreign Office) as voting members without portfolio. The appointment of two non-Prussians (Hofmann was a Hessian, Bulow a Mecklenburger) as Prussian ministers was a sensational development. More importantly, as imperial officials they were directly accountable to Bismarck, a fact
that must certainly influence their behavior in the cabinet. Although a Prussian minister without portfolio, Delbruck had possessed no vote in the cabinet
and was, furthermore, a career official who respected the lines of authority
under the Prussian system. Naturally the Prussian ministers, particularly
Camphausen, objected to this turn of events.97 That they were impotent to
prevent it is a measure of their declining power (and that of the cabinet itself)
vis-a-vis Bismarck. The ministers would have been even more upset had they
known that the chancellor contemplated a still more drastic step. When Lucius visited Varzin in late September 1876, he found his master toying with
the idea of giving the "Reich ministries" (a term he increasingly applied to
the various parallel agencies of the empire) more "substance" by appointing
some of their chiefs as Prussian ministers with portfolio; he thought the Prussian Ministry of Finance should be excepted, although its function should be
limited henceforth to fiscal administration.98

Personal union between the executives of the Reich and Prussia would have
meant, in effect, complete subordination of the Prussian cabinet to the chancellor and destruction of the Prussian tradition of ministerial collegiality. It
would have ended Prussian resistance to Bismarck's will and solved the enduring problem of coordinating the Reich and Prussian governments, but it
would also have greatly increased the unitary over the federal principle in the
German constitutional balance. Perhaps for this reason Bismarck did not pursue the idea at that time. Instead, he sought to reinvigorate the Bundesrat by
urging non-Prussian governments to take a more active policy in imperial
affairs. Rather than strike for greater direct authority, he employed his old
technique of mobilizing a countervailing power to overcome what he liked to
call "Prussian particularism."9'
The drift of German domestic politics during 1876 was also in the general
direction Bismarck had charted. His effort to seduce the National Liberal
party and to divorce it from the Progressive party was evident in remarks made
to the national liberal deputy Robert von Benda in July 1876 at Bad Kissingen. Bismarck denied the accusation that the resignation of Delbriick presaged a shift to a conservative policy. Delbriick himself, he asserted, had recommended Hofmann as his successor. The Hessian was, furthermore, the
most liberal of all candidates proposed. As before, Bismarck wanted to depend, he said, upon the National Liberal party for support; rumors that he
wished to divide it were false. The Center, extreme conservatives, and progressives were his enemies. His major concern was that national liberals would
permit themselves to be taken in tow by the progressives. Confronted by a
hostile majority under progressive leadership, he would have no choice but to
seek a majority on the right that would include the Center and the agrarians,
whose complaints of economic injustice had some justification.'00
Bismarck's denial that he wished to split the National Liberal party may
have been genuine at this time. In September 1876 he told Lucius that he
favored "further cooperation with the national liberals, who were still the
most reasonable party."101 Their conduct in fashioning the compromise on
judiciary legislation in December was further proof of their "reasonableness."
During these months Bismarck even had kind remarks to make about Lasker.
At tea one evening in late November he surprised his aides by not joining in
the general laughter at a joke told on Lasker. "I would gladly have Lasker at
my side in the cabinet," he actually said. "The problem is that he is too manysided. Wahl macht Qual. I don't know whether he should be entrusted with
justice, finance, interior, or commerce.",ai Obviously the prince jested, de» GW, XIV, 879S8o.

spite his serious demeanor. Yet Lasker gave him no cause for complaint that
winter, and Bismarck was probably gratified to hear through Lucius that the
deputy was as antagonized as were the right-wing national liberals by the attacks of the progressives during the January election campaign.I03
After the election the official Provinzial'Korrespondenz predicted that the
new Reichstag would be dominated by a majority composed of the three parties on the right of the chamber. The only change produced by the election,
it declared, had occurred within the ranks of the progovernment parties (conservatives, free conservatives, and national liberals), not between them and
the antigovernment parties (progressives, centrists, Poles, particularists, and
social democrats). As before the government had a "reliable majority of forty
to fifty votes for the most essential interests of the Reich."104 When the
Reichstag met, there seemed to be concrete proof of the existence of such a
majority coalition. In recent years the election of the presiding officers had
always been taken as proof of the continuing solidarity of the liberal front.
Customarily the president and first vice-president were national liberals
(Forckenbeck and Stauffenberg), the second vice-president a progressive (Hanel), but in February 1877 the national liberals cast their ballots not for Hanel
but for a free conservative (Hohenlohe-Langenburg), who was elected. The
Reichstag appeared to have a new majority composed of those parties that in
1874 had pushed through the compromise on the iron budget and in 1876 the
compromise over the law codes.IOS
Beyond question important changes were under way within the National
Liberal party during the winter of 1876-1877. The steady growth of the socialist movement from election to election revealed an unsettling degree of
social alienation and protest. Limited as they were by the narrowness of their
class and group interests and by their perception of what policies of social
reform were possible within the boundaries of liberal ideology, the national
liberals were inclined to turn to the right, to seek in the Prussian-German
establishment rescue from the dangers of proletarian unrest. The major unifying laws, furthermore, were now in the statute books and so also were the
Kulturkampf laws. Hence Bismarck no longer had any need of the progressives. His warning to Benda that he would, if necessary, dispense with the
support of both liberal parties (another classic example of the tactic of balanced options) had to be taken seriously. If national liberals wished to remain
in contact with the Bismarck government and hence in a position to influence
story, possibly apochryphal, Bismarck once remarked in jest to Lasker that the two might one
day sit together in the Prussian cabinet. "That prospect," Lasker replied, "was cut off only a few
days after my birth." Robert von Mohl, Lebens-ErinnCTHngen, 1799-1875 (Stuttgart, 1902), II,

its policy, even to a limited degree, they had to sever their connections with
democratic liberalism. Yet they were aware that a compact with Bismarck was
perilous for the weaker partner. They might be forced, once they had turned
their backs on the left-liberals, to accept reactionary and protectionist measures that would deprive them of the tattered remnants of their liberalism.
Forckenbeck, a good weather vane, sought escape from the dilemma by
advocating neutrality. The time had come, he told a gathering in Breslau, to
stand still and hold fast to what had been attained. "Whereas at one time
legislation lagged too far behind the wishes of the people, now it has perhaps
gone too far ahead of them." Much had been accomplished, but now the
people needed time to catch up. The national liberals, he warned, were being
invited to dine with old foes. "They sit down with us at the table only to cut
the tablecloth between us more easily." "Therefore," he cried, shifting his
metaphors, "no follies, no excessive haste! Back to the trenches for a manly
defense of what has been accomplished up to now! Everything else will follow
of itself!"'06

The "Chancellor Crisis" of 1877

OLITICAL progress during 1875-1876 did not improve either Bismarck's health or state of mind. In the summer of 1876 he spent six
weeks at Bad Kissingen, followed by nearly four months at Varzin.
In late August he complained that his nerves were so bad he could
not tolerate as many as three persons at one time; he felt guilty about being
inconsiderate to his family.' The summers did not suffice, he wrote in Sep'
tember, to restore the strength expended during the winter months.2 He returned to Berlin on November 21, but immediately wanted to flee and spend
the entire winter in the country. "That is the only thing that does me any
good." So great was the burden of work in Berlin that he felt "on the verge of
collapse."3 During the following months he frequently complained of ill
health. Facial neuralgia returned to plague him, and again he lay awake nights
thinking about "everything adverse that has happened to me for thirty years."
Bitter thoughts about the Kreuzzeitung conservatives and the Dekforanten still
coursed through his mind, causing Lucius to conclude that he "was more angry than sick."4 What appears to have bothered him most that winter, however, was the fear that he might be losing his hold on the Kaiser.

Struggle for the Kaiser's Mind
One year after he assumed the imperial crown Wilhelm's health began to
deteriorate, and in the summer of 1873 he suffered a paralytic stroke. His
recovery was slow, and, as Bismarck later recalled, the ruler's power of concentration declined. Whether speaking or listening, the monarch frequently
lost track of the discussion.5 To clear up misunderstandings that arose from
his daily reading of despatches and other state documents cost the chancellor
time and effort. "It would be more useful," Bismarck told Lucius, "if the Kaiser spent his time playing patience." When the chancellor argued a point,

Wilhelm would say, "I know I'm becoming senile, and I can't help it that I
live so long."6
In this condition the Kaiser became more susceptible to the influence of
Empress Augusta, court officials, and the aristocrats and foreign diplomats
(particularly French Ambassador Viscount Gontaut-Biron) who frequented
the palace. In his memoirs Bismarck relived his suspicions of these years in a
fascinating chapter titled "intrigues." Empress Augusta, he wrote, had a
strong liking for Frenchmen and Catholics acquired in her youth. Before the
railway came, German Protestant courts relieved the boredom of small-town

life by offering hospitality to English and French noblemen, some with shadowy antecedents; Catholic noblemen and church dignitaries were also regarded as "exotic" and "interesting." Customs had changed in the new age of
fast transportation, but Augusta still clung to the attitudes of the Weimar
court of her childhood. "A Catholic priest seemed to her more impressive
than a Protestant cleric of equal rank and importance, the friendship of a
Frenchman or Englishman more attractive than that of a fellow German, and
the applause of Catholics more satisfying than that of fellow Protestants."
Hence Gontaut-Biron had ready access to the imperial court. Perhaps on his
recommendation the empress, who preferred French-speaking servants, en-

gaged as her "reader" Auguste Gerard, whom Bismarck suspected of being a
French agent.7
Augusta, Bismarck believed, had regarded the "new era" government as
"her cabinet" and she remained unreconciled to its fall. Whatever course was
steered thereafter—whether liberal or conservative, anti'Austrian or proAustrian—she was sure to veer in the opposite direction. In this she was
strengthened by Alexander von Schleinitz, former foreign minister and now
house minister to the Kaiser. For years Bismarck suspected Schleinitz of head'
ing a "kind of kitchen cabinet" (Gegenmirusterium) in the royal palace that
supplied the empress with political reports, based on dubious sources, with
the purpose of influencing the Kaiser. Through this channel, so the chancellor believed, numerous copies of the Reichs^ocke and other slandering
publications reached the palace and related courts. Whenever the enfeebled
Wilhelm balked at his advice, Bismarck suspected that the empress had supplied her spouse with pleas and arguments at the breakfast table. Finally the
chancellor, knowing that Augusta listened from an adjacent room, complained to Wilhelm about the conduct of his wife. That same evening at a
court festival he told Augusta herself that she endangered her consort's health
by the advice she gave him. He could not forget, he wrote, how her back
stiffened and her eyes flared. She broke off the conversation and swept away,
leaving him impenitent but impressed. Never had he seen her "so beautiful."8
Bismarck believed that Augusta was the "crystallization point" of the opposition within the Prussian-German establishment. "All of the foes whom I
had unavoidably made in the most disparate areas in the course of my political
struggles and in the interest of my governmental service found in their common hatred of me a bond that was for the time being stronger than their
mutual antagonism. They postponed their hostility in order to gain strength
against me."9 In December 1876 he even appealed to Gontaut-Biron for help
in his "continuing struggle against persons of both sexes at court."10 A month
later Lucius found him uncharitable toward the Kaiser, even offensively so.
Wilhelm, the chancellor griped, treated his ministers no better than did other
monarchs. "He is as hard as stone and as cold. Gratitude is alien to him. . . .
He keeps me in office only because he thinks I can still do something for him."

Need of appreciation, Bismarck confessed, was his own "most vulnerable
point."11
Bismarck's sense of isolation had reached a new level. He felt abused and
betrayed by members of his own social caste and unappreciated by the man
whom he had boosted to power and glory. Anger at his colleagues in the
Prussian cabinet and their subordinates in the ministries also reached a new
peak. On March 10, 1877, he appeared in the Reichstag for the first time that
session and, after listening to an attack by Richter on the government for
tardy presentation of the budget bill, astonished the deputies by joining in the
assault. For officials and agencies to quarrel while preparing the budget bill,
he declared, was only natural, but afterward the frictions continued and peace
was not easily restored. Officials preferred to write memoranda rather than
turn to the chancellor for a quick decision. Prussian ministries were particularly prone, he declared, to the bureaucratic particularism peculiar to Germans. "I can say that the Reich's tide is running backward. An ebb is approaching." He claimed that he alone among Prussian ministers supported the
interests of the Reich. If no progress was made toward reform, that was not
because capacities were lacking. "On the contrary, there are too many men;
what I lack is agreement by the men who are there, without which nothing
can be done. . . . Friction behind the scenes . . . takes up three-fourths of
my time."12
Again anger and self-pity impaired Bismarck's political judgment. Most of
the charges he enunciated in the Reichstag were couched in general terms but
not all. In late 1875, he declared, he had struggled for months to persuade
and finally to compel the Imperial Admiralty to reduce its budget requests for
1876; then to his astonishment the admiralty yielded without a struggle to a
further cut demanded by Richter in the Reichstag. He had not expected, he
mocked, to find Richter's influence within the government greater than his
own. I3 The chief target of this attack was General Albrecht von Stosch, chief
of the Imperial Admiralty and Prussian minister without portfolio. But Stosch
was merely the point man of an entire enemy company whom the chancellor
wished to annihilate. Behind the general stood, so Bismarck believed, Empress Augusta, Crown Princess Victoria, and the rest of the faction at court
with whom he struggled for influence over the Kaiser.
Bismarck's relations with Stosch had become increasingly acrimonious

since the latter's appointment as head of the admiralty in 1872. The general
was strong willed, ambitious, and independent—qualities that Bismarck did
not appreciate. Stosch's difficulties with the chancellor also arose from the
ambiguity of his position. For his command functions the chief of the admiralty was responsible to the Kaiser, for his administrative functions to the
chancellor. The line of distinction was not always clear, but Stosch compounded the problem by occasional carelessness where the chancellor's prerogatives were concerned. The general, on the other hand, complained of
Bismarck's interference in command functions and of the demands his foreign
policy made on a fleet that was starved for funds. Stosch was also an intimate
friend of Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm, on whose staff he had served in
two wars and to whom he regularly reported what was said in meetings of the
Prussian cabinet. In addition, he was closely associated with Karl von Normann, secretary to Crown Princess Victoria, and with Franz von Roggenbach, political adviser to Empress Augusta.I4 In private Bismarck spoke of the
general as "an intriguer and spy who does not open his mouth in cabinet
meetings, but then tells everything to the crown prince and to his majesty."15
The chancellor suspected that Stosch aspired to participate in a "Gladstone
cabinet" composed of liberal officials and deputies.
If true, this would have been only natural, given the precarious state of
Bismarck's health, the advanced age and declining powers of the Kaiser, and
the likelihood that Friedrich Wilhelm would soon succeed to the throne. Yet
Bismarck, despite his constant and rather careless talk of resignation, treated
speculations of this kind as proof of disloyalty and perfidy. His memoirs are
spiced with paranoiac charges of intrigue and conspiracy that, judging from
contemporary evidence, accurately reflected his mood during his last two decades in power. "6 Even without proof, Bismarck seems to have presumed that
men whose personal connections seemed threatening must be plotting against
him. To them he attributed that same burning need to have "disposition over
the whole" with which he himself had been consumed during the long years
before his appointment as the king's first minister in 1862.
Bismarck had often attempted to force Stosch to resign. In 1876 he even
tried to repeat the destruction of Arnim by charging the general with treason,
but he was deterred by Heinrich von Friedberg, chief of the Imperial Office of
Justice, who told him the accusation could not be substantiated.17 Obviously
Bismarck hoped that a denunciation in parliament would make the general's
position untenable. Indeed it was widely assumed in the press and Reichstag

361

that Stosch was a "dying man."18 Yet the Kaiser had a high opinion of the
general, who, furthermore, was able to prove inaccuracies in Bismarck's
charge. In messages, whose skillfulness belies Bismarck's presumptions of senility, Wilhelm pointed out that both had erred: Stosch by yielding to Richter
without the chancellor's consent, Bismarck by delaying for fifteen months to
bring the dereliction to the Kaiser's attention. On March 24, 1877, Wilhelm
asked Stosch to remain in office, and so the general did, much to Bismarck's
chagrin, until 1883.19
No sooner had Wilhelm rejected Stosch's resignation than he faced another—Bismarck's. This was the famous request for retirement of March 27,
1877, which Wilhelm rejected on April 7, reportedly with the marginal note:
"Never!"20 Unlike that of 1875, this request was patently insincere. Thoughts
of retirement, to be sure, were never far from Bismarck's mind in these years.
What a relief it would be, he mused, to exchange the ugly sights and smells
of industrializing Berlin for the bucolic peace of Varzin and Friedrichsruh!
How satisfying it would be to swap roles with his carping critics, to let them
wrestle with the cares and responsibilities of office, while he sat in the Reichstag and gave vent to his hostility. Let the nation see how incompetent and
dishonest the blackguards were! Then perhaps he would return in triumph
fully rested and health restored, brought back by a grateful monarch grown
deaf to boudoir and backstairs intrigues, supported by a massive coalition of
docile deputies elected by appreciative citizens (including a sobered gentry
that now comprehended he was their only salvation), and instantly obeyed
by servile ministers and quaking officials who no longer had any aim other
than to discern and execute the chancellor's will.21
The master of Realpolitik did not confuse daydreams with reality. Perhaps
the threat of resignation could be made to accomplish the same effect. Unlike
the request of 1875, that of 1877 was quickly reported in the public press
where it produced consternation. "Thousands of rumors and combinations for

replacing him quickly filled the air."22 Privately, Bismarck spoke more of an
extended leave than of retirement, and on March 29 he summoned the Prussian cabinet (except for Stosch) to discuss arrangements for running the government in his absence.23 That Wilhelm took several days to reply to the
request left the public under the impression that a change in regime was imminent. Yet Lasker's surmise that the delay caused the chancellor "great concern" was probably incorrect.24
Bismarck knew full well how Wilhelm would react, for he had already tried
him out. On December 8, 1876, the prince had confided to the Kaiser his
wish to flee Berlin and the burdens of office. Wilhelm's face grew red with
anger, the prince reported to Gontaut-Biron. "Look at me," he said, "I am
eighteen years older than you and still holding out." "That doesn't surprise
me, your majesty," Bismarck replied. "The horse always tires faster than the
rider."25 In April Wilhelm's reaction was the same. "Shall I make myself ridiculous in my old age? You will be unfaithful, if you desert me." From Johanna, the Baroness Spitzemberg heard on April 14 that the Kaiser had "cried
like a child and spoken of abdication."26
Bismarck's request for retirement in 1877, unlike those of 1872 and 1875,
stemmed more from political than physical distress. According to reports, his
health in March-April 1877 was actually better than during the preceding
winter.27 When Moritz Busch told him on April n how well he looked, Bismarck would have none of it. "Yes," he said, "others think so too. People
misjudge me in three respects: they consider me healthier, wealthier, and
more influential than I really am—particularly more influential."28 A number
of political reverses in recent months had left him "obviously in bad humor."
For the first time the lesser states had willfully outvoted Prussia in the Bundesrat and, ignoring Bismarck's personal wishes, located the new Imperial
Supreme Court in Leipzig rather than Berlin. The Reichstag had approved
the decision by a large majority, despite Friedberg's protestations in behalf of
the government. To Bismarck's annoyance Lasker used the occasion to attack
him for failing to attend the debate. The budget debate had also left a bitter
taste in Bismarck's mouth. "Richter and Hanel scolded the government like
uncouth youngsters, as one might rebuke a lazy servant." Wilhelm's refusal to

part with Stosch inflicted yet another injury,29 which Bismarck himself compounded by a gratuitous remark to deputies at a parliamentary soiree on
March 17. He would not, he declared, retract the accusation made in parliament concerning Stosch's conduct in 1875, despite the documentary evidence Stosch had produced to disprove it.3° This statement, widely disseminated in the press, had strengthened the public assumption that Stosch was
doomed. When he survived, the world could see that there were, after all,
limits to Bismarck's power.
Hence Wilhelm had to be reminded once more how dependent he was
upon the services of his Brandenburg vassal. That a crisis loomed in foreign
affairs—Russia's attack on the Ottoman Empire—made the moment particularly opportune. Ministers, officials, deputies, palace "intriguers," foreign
governments, and the public had also to be shown that Bismarck's position
was unshaken and would remain so at least as long as Wilhelm lived. Bismarck's aim was to renew his grip on the governmental apparatus in preparation for a fresh assault on the interconnected problems of the Reich's financial
dependence on the states, Prussian particularism, railway policy, and the fiscal power of parliament. In January 1877 Lucius recorded him as saying that
only the desire to bring order in the "muddled economic situation" held him
in office.31 At the height of the "chancellor crisis" in early April the free
conservative Post claimed to know that the prince would remain "if adequately supported in his intended reforms by his Prussian colleagues or if supported by a Reichstag majority capable of freeing the ministers from their
scruples." The Kolnische Zeitung recalled Bismarck's recent words: "When a
hunter is exhausted from tramping about in the potato fields and wants to go
home, no one will stop him by telling him that partridges can be shot in the
neighborhood. To inform him of a wild boar in a nearby wood is another
matter. For a boar hunt he will find new strength."32 Before joining the chase,
however, he required some months off the scene. In the warmth and security
of his family circle he expected to reassemble the bits and pieces of his nervous
system in preparation for a fresh attack upon those who still resisted his will.
Bismarck's request of 1877 for release from office, the Kaiser's refusal to
release him, and the grant of another extended leave were fully reported in
the German press. Bismarck himself made sure of that. Before departing from
Berlin, he summoned Busch and gave him material for a series of seven articles that were published in Grenzboten between April 7 and June 27. The socalled "friction articles" appealed directly to German public opinion to assist
the chancellor in removing the persons and influences whose intrigues and

incompetencies had brought him to the point of resignation. They outlined
in some detail Bismarck's charges against mostly unnamed but easily identifiable persons in the cabinet, at court, and in parliament—particularly against
the "high-born lady" who sympathized with Catholics and undermined the
government's position in the Kulturkampf, the Prussian ministers committed
to Manchester economics who failed to produce necessary railway and tax
legislation, and specifically against the sinister influence of Schleinitz whose
political activities exceeded his proper duties as chief administrator of royal
properties. Unless changes occurred in persons or attitudes, one article
warned, Bismarck would not return to office. His extended leave would become a permanent retirement.33

Another "Extended Leave"
Bismarck left Berlin on April 16, 1877, and did not officially return to duty
for ten months. During his absence two old problems—those of the Reich's
executive structure and the delegation of authority—again became acute. As
related earlier, the power of the Imperial Chancellor's Office (Reichskanzler'
amt) had been reduced, following Delbruck's dismissal, by the conversion of
a number of its departments into independent agencies. Under Hofmann's
presidency the office had retained authority only over the Reich's financial
and commercial affairs. This decentralization made the position of chancellor
all the more important, for he was the only "responsible" official to whom all
the agencies of the Reich were subordinate. If Bismarck was actually to be
relieved of the routine functions of his office while on leave, someone had to
be deputized to act for him. The prince proposed that Camphausen, who was
vice-president of the Prussian cabinet as well as minister of finance, be empowered to substitute for him as chancellor and to countersign official documents dealing with domestic affairs. But Wilhelm doubted the constitutionality of delegating the chancellor's power of countersignature, was distrustful
of Camphausen's liberalism, and reluctant to take any step that might "make
difficult the prince's resumption of his duties." Instead the Kaiser appointed
Hofmann to act as the chancellor's deputy (SteUvertreter) in domestic affairs
and Bernhard von Biilow, the top official in the Imperial Foreign Office, to be
his deputy in foreign affairs. Neither was granted authority to countersign
documents. Their role was to take care of routine business, not to formulate
policy.34
These arrangements did not entirely relieve Bismarck from the burdens of
office during the next ten months. This is clear from the log of his activities:

marck's sons, Herbert and Bill, were busy with dictations and drafts even at
Kissingen and Gastein. In the fall, they were assisted at Varzin by Friedrich
von Holstein, privy counselor for foreign affairs. The developing war in the
Balkans, difficulties over Nicaragua, and commercial negotiations with Austria claimed Bismarck's attention. But there were also issues in internal affairs
that he could not or would not escape. Much of his time and energy was spent
in calculating the next steps toward fulfillment of the plan he had drafted in
1875. When winter came he set about the execution of his decisions while
still at Varzin. Here the volume of business must have approximated what he
would have encountered had he been in Berlin.
The public saw little of Bismarck on his travels. To be sure, his presence in
large towns and summer resorts generated excitement and curiosity. In avoiding the crowds he detested, Bismarck found useful the private railway car
presented to him by several railway companies. At Bad Kissingen he occupied
an apartment in the Obere Saline at some distance from the bath house and
hotels. In the morning he walked down the long winding path to the Kurhaus,
a route heavily guarded by police. Later in the day, hundreds of vacationers
gathered "in rows like a regiment of soldiers" at the Kurhaus entrance, where
a carriage lent by King Ludwig waited. But their hopes of seeing the chancellor were dashed when the driver, acting on a signal, drove off smartly to another entrance to pick up his passenger.36
Bad Kissingen lies in a wide valley surrounded by cultivated fields and forested hills. Its waters, heavily impregnated with salt and iron, were considered
healthy for both internal and external use, including a variety of ailments.
Bad Gastein, on the other hand, is situated in the Austrian Alps on a steep
northern slope 3,500 feet above the sea. The baths, which are fed by hot
mineral springs bubbling from caverns beneath towering granite cliffs, were
recommended for nervous afflictions, general disability, skin diseases, gout,
and rheumatism.37 Bismarck disliked mountains and abhorred Gastein with
its thundering waterfalls. But Gastein was Wilhelm's favorite spa and in the
past the Kaiser's presence there had dictated Bismarck's. In the autumn of
1877 the prince's doctors recommended Gastein for medical reasons. He
dreaded the trip and sought to evade it by one excuse or another. (At one
point he even insisted that the journey would tire his old dog Sultan, who
could not be left behind!) But family and physicians prevailed.38
The diary and letters of Tiedemann contain a delightful record of this cure
and vacation in the Alps. Among his vignettes are descriptions of a day-long
excursion with the Bismarck family by wagon, horse, and foot up a misty vale
to the Nassfelde atop the Tauern range, from which could be seen the snows'' Tiedemann, Sechs Jahre, p. 154.

covered peaks and glaciers of the Alpine massif; of afternoon Spaziergange
along the slopes of the Gastein valley during which the prince showed him
points of interest, such as the bench where he had briefed Wilhelm on the
Gastein Convention of 1865; of Bismarck's gracious reception of Count
Beust, the old foe whom he had so thoroughly defeated; of the evening meals
alone with the Bismarcks and Princess Odescalchi, a lively Hungarian brunette with "piquant face," who firmly believed in table-rapping poltergeists;
of the seance during which a "long dead diplomat" rapped out "the most unbelievable political secrets," which the chancellor, struggling to hide his
mirth, duly recorded. To witness Bismarck under these relaxed circumstances,
secure and serene in the bosom of his family, was a revelation to Tiedemann,
by no means an uncritical observer. "Our descendants will not doubt in the
least that he was one of the greatest men whom the old and new worlds have
produced. But only a few will be able to testify that he was also the most
charming, because his proud and distant manner allowed few to see him as he
actually was. That I belong to those few will remain the pride of my life."39
Bismarck's extended leave of 1877 was not an unqualified success. According to Tiedemann, he returned from Friedrichsruh on May 20 looking "fresh
and well, very tanned." After Bad Kissingen he looked "excellent" and "very
well, but thinner."40 In July he caught a cold that delayed the departure for
Gastein. But germs were not his only problem. As he grappled with issues
that would face him on his return to duty, he was again besieged by anger and
nervous disorders. On August n , 1877, he wrote to Wilhelm that he felt
weaker now than before the cure in Kissingen. The least work affected his
nerves so adversely that he could not sleep. Domestic rather than foreign
affairs were the cause. In his absence the ministers at Berlin were drafting illconsidered legislation. Hofmann, Eulenburg, Camphausen, and Achenbach
were the targets of his wrath. Only Friedenthal had his confidence.41
At Gastein the pendulum swung toward health again, and Bismarck returned to Varzin at the end of September "relatively eager to work and reorganize."42 Tiedemann had never seen him in a better mood. "Obviously he
felt unusually well and comfortable when alone with Herbert, Holstein, and
me; he let himself go completely and was from morning to night in good
humor, accessible to every joke. Much work was accomplished. But we found
time to ride many hours every day, and after the noonday meal engaged in
the most interesting and pleasant chats." The atmosphere was so exceptional
that both Holstein and Tiedemann doubted it could last. They were right.
On the evening of October 25, the two privy counselors heard a commo39

tion below and raced downstairs. They found the chancellor sitting on the
floor with Sultan's head in his lap. The dog had disappeared for several hours,
and, on his return, Bismarck had punished him so severely that internal injuries resulted. Overcome with remorse, Bismarck whispered tenderly to the
dying animal, seeking to hide his tears from the onlookers. When Sultan
stopped breathing, Bismarck stood up and retired alone to his bedroom. Next
day, after a sleepless night, he rode off in streaming rain, silent and morose,
to retrace the paths where he had last been with the dog. Under way he
confessed to Tiedemann, "It is sinful to lose one's heart as I have to an animal. Nothing in the world was dearer to me." Holstein summed it up: "The
prince has lost a friend and feels isolated." For days the chancellor mourned
for Sultan and bitterly reproached himself for having whipped the mastiff so
hard. "He accuses himself of having a violent temper, of being brutal, and of
giving pain to everyone who comes in contact with him. Then, he again
reproaches himself for mourning so long and deeply the death of an animal."43
One misfortune followed another. Not long after Sultan was buried, one of
the prince's estate managers killed himself when exposed for embezzling over
30,000 marks. Bismarck's daughter Marie caught a severe cold, and Johanna,
while nursing her, stumbled in the darkened room and sustained a bad cut
under the eye. During November a stream of visitors, not all of them welcome, invaded the prince's privacy and left him unhappy.44 Friedenthal,
whom Bismarck had praised so highly to the Kaiser in August, came to discuss
a reorganization of the government and angered the prince by seeking greater
power for himself. Again Bismarck, "discouraged and out of sorts," talked of
"resigning" and was supported in this mood by his wife, daughter, and doctors.45 Tiedemann gained the impression that Germany was on the brink of
the greatest crisis of the decade in domestic affairs. The air was full of incendiary material. On December 10, he wrote that the prince had decided to
remain in office, but only if his wishes were met regarding changes in personnel and organization of the government; if denied, he would "abdicate." This
time he would not take partial payment; if either the Reichstag or "another

still more important place" rejected his proposals, they would have to go on
without him.46
The changes upon which Bismarck insisted were intended to execute the
general purposes he had formulated during his leave of 1875. They were many
and complex and appear in no one source but can be deduced from his actions, letters, official documents, and recorded remarks. His basic aim was to
get a firmer grip on the levers of power in order to force the bureaucratic and
political machine onto a track that he believed would consolidate the Reich.
Where the executive was concerned, he hoped simultaneously to reduce his
own involvement in routine affairs and to increase his personal authority over
the Prussian cabinet. By lowering the visibility of the imperial executive
through decentralization and by bringing Prussian ministers into imperial affairs, he hoped to gain both the cooperation and subordination of the latter.
Previously Prussian bureaucratic self-interest had dictated resistance and obstructionism; under the new system he expected it to dictate participation and
cooperation in imperial affairs. As imperial state secretaries the Prussian ministers would come under Bismarck's direct control and no longer be in a position to evade his authority. Obstructing ministers would have two choices:
either resign or yield.
The issues that could compel the ministers to make these choices were
chiefly those intended to establish a firm fiscal foundation for the Reich—by
continuing nationalization of the German railway system and securing new
indirect taxes for the Reich, including an increased levy on tobacco sales that
would lead ultimately to a state monopoly. More income for the Reich would
mean reduction of the annual assessments levied on the states. Abolition of
those assessments would deprive the Reichstag of a financial and political
weapon. Bismarck hoped, furthermore, to achieve these ends with the cooperation of national liberals (at least its right wing), for whom he now actually
conceived a role within the Prussian and imperial executives. By finding a
place for Rudolf von Bennigsen in the government he aimed to bind the moderate majority of that party to the government. Hopefully the result would be
a durable coalition between new conservatives, free conservatives, and national liberals that would give his government a firmer base of political support in the Reichstag and Prussian Chamber of Deputies. If all of this could
have been accomplished, Bismarck's influence would have been secure in every arena except one—the imperial court. That, Bismarck had to admit, was
outside his reach.47

Another Chancellor Cnsis
Bismarck's "resignation" and "extended leave" reawakened doubts about the
stability of the governmental system he had devised for Germany. It came at
a time of deepening crisis in both foreign and domestic affairs. The economic
difficulties that had begun with the crash continued to depress the capitalistic
system throughout the world. The wait for a decisive upswing in the business
cycle stretched out from year to year far beyond the expectations of employers, workers, and governments alike. In the Balkans new tensions developed
between Austria and Russia over the fate of an independent Bulgaria that
would soon threaten the harmony of the Three Emperors League. Bismarck's
confessed incapacitation and his long absence from Berlin caused many of
those concerned with public affairs to wonder whether the prince and the
governmental system that depended upon him were equal to the problems the
country faced. The time appeared to have come, only six to seven years after
founding of the Reich, for a major change in its constitutional order.
"Naturally Bismarck's retirement is our chief interest," wrote Eugen Richter. "That will produce changes in party relationships so colossal that they
cannot be predicted. The tariff protectionists, who have become especially
dangerous, have the greatest cause to mourn. If he actually remains away from
all business for a full year, that will be the equivalent of a complete retirement."48 In the Reichstag budget debates of March-April 1877, liberals rebuked Hofmann for presenting a tardy budget bill and for failing to present a
comprehensive plan for tax reform. They revived the dormant demand for a
cabinet form of government in the Reich. Lasker, seconded by Richter and
Hanel, went even further, asserting that only a parliamentary system could
end this isolation and lack of coordination between government and parliament; otherwise the two institutions would continue to be "impenetrable
mysteries" to each other. The Reichstag's attitude must be the government's.
Only a cabinet based on a parliamentary majority could achieve this. In April
Hanel decried the "modest" role given parliament in the chancellor crisis. All
Europe was aroused by the news of Bismarck's resignation, but the Reichstag
had to defend its right even to discuss the matter. Even Bennigsen warned
that the national liberals would raise the issue of cabinet government on Bismarck's return to duty, seeking in harmony with the chancellor to fill the
holes in the imperial constitution.
In reply Bismarck lectured the deputies about the evils of impatience, about
the hazards of shaking the tree before the roots of the empire were firmly
planted. The imperial agencies, he declared, already possessed the characteristics of ministries and the chancellor that of an "imperial prime minister."
Ministerial organization as such was not objectionable, only the collegial form

371

of it. The Prussian example showed that a Collegium, because it proceeded by
majority vote, was more inclined toward the negative than the positive. Under the Reich's federal system, moreover, imperial ministries would always
"hover in the air" because they lacked the power and function of direct administration. The real power would always reside in the state ministries, particularly the Prussian, which commanded the bureaucratic structures that actually governed Germany. An imperial cabinet of Prussian type would only
drive the Reich and Prussian governments apart.
He did not deny, however, that changes were advisable and proceeded, in
seemingly impromptu fashion, to expound his views on what form they might
take. The reduction of the Imperial Chancellor's Office should be completed
by the separation from it of two more agencies, one for finance, the other for
trade. Prussian ministries (he mentioned those of finance, commerce, and
justice) ought to be divided, separating their administrative and legislative
functions. The legislative ministries thus created should be brought into relationship to their counterpart agencies in the Reich. Apparently this was to
be accomplished through "personal union," that is, appointment of the same
person to head both bodies.49
Though Bismarck described these ideas as "dreams," his experiences while
on leave only strengthened his conviction about the necessity of major
changes in government organization. In the letter of August 11 to the Kaiser
(previously quoted), he attributed his nervousness and sleeplessness to the
necessity of fighting against legislation injurious to industry being drafted by
colleagues during his absence. If he gave up the struggle in the interest of
recuperation, the result would be an "incurable schism" between himself and
his colleagues in domestic affairs. Even more distressing was the fact that the
ministers gave him no support in preparing necessary reforms in tariffs, taxation, and railway affairs. As property owners he and Friedenthal were the only
ministers who belonged both to the government and the governed and "felt
the shoe where it pinched." Ministers, officials, and most legislators were "educated people" without property and uninvolved in industry and trade. Their
bills were impractical and harmful. Unfortunately, the few businessmen in
parliament were more active in politicking than in representing their material
interests.5"
In October 1877 the Prussian cabinet voted, six to three (Hofmann, Bulow, and Friedenthal in the minority), to locate a new regional court of appeals in the Prussian city of Celle (Hanover) rather than in the free city of
Bremen, which was the chancellor's choice. For nearly two years Bismarck
had argued that the government must, in implementing the new imperial
statute on judicial organization (Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz), give precedence to

imperial over Prussian interests. Now he viewed the final vote in the cabinet
as further proof that even reputed liberals, once they became Prussian ministers (for example, Camphausen, FaIk, and Leonhardt), tended to be infected
with the virus of Prussian particularism. Through Biilow, Bismarck informed
his colleagues that he did not regard the decision as binding on himself as
chancellor and that he would seek remedy through imperial legislation that
would preserve the interests of the Reich.51
Biilow had become Bismarck's most trusted lieutenant even in domestic
affairs, for Hofmann was no longer in high regard. The prince complained
increasingly of the latter's "weakness," "helplessness," and "tactlessness." "A
capacity for public speaking always makes me doubtful about the judgment
and understanding of the person concerned. Most people are burdened with
a considerable mortgage of pride. Their capital worth is what remains after
subtracting that mortgage."52 When the Hessian did exercise some initiative,
on the other hand, Bismarck accused him of exceeding his authority, of failing to consult, and of exaggerating, like Delbruck before him, the importance
of the chancellor's office in his dealings with the Bundesrat and the state
governments.53 "Hofmann has given me more trouble in recent months than
all other ministers together," Bismarck said in early December 1877. "Prussian particularism is the worst enemy of the Reich. The most influential imperial offices must be united with the Prussian ministries. The vice-chancellor
must be Prussian vice-president. The Imperial Chancellor's Office in its present form must come to an end. What to do with Hofmann is a difficult question."5'»
By the fall of 1877 Bismarck had decided upon a new tactic in his struggle
to force the governmental machine along the charted course. In the Delbruck
era he had built up the Reich executive at the cost of Prussian and other state
governments. Now he proposed to reduce the profile of the imperial bureaucracy and increase Prussia's role in imperial affairs. Beginning in September
1877 he issued a series of directives ordering imperial officials to avoid the
expression "imperial government" in official correspondence, to cease the
long-standing practice of drafting "presidential" bills for consideration by
Bundesrat and Reichstag, and to prepare (through budgetary arrangements)
for the separation of the financial department from the Imperial Chancellor's
Office. Simultaneously he renewed his efforts to force his Prussian colleagues
to produce bills providing for new taxes and giving real regulatory power to
the Imperial Railway Office. In January 1878 he ordered the Prussian minister

Camphausen, rather than the imperial official Hofmann (much to the latter's
distress), to represent him at the opening of the Reichstag.55
If Hofmann led Bismarck's blacklist, Camphausen came close behind.
"Slay Augusta, Camphausen, Lasker, and their cliques for me," he told the
Baroness Spitzemberg in April 1877, "then I can continue in office."56 In
Bismarck's view Camphausen, as Prussian minister of finance and vice-president of the cabinet, had the primary responsibility for initiating the needed
tax and tariff legislation.57 But Camphausen resented Bismarck's domineering
ways and prided himself on being the only minister who was not "in flight"
before the chancellor.58 As a Manchester liberal, furthermore, he was understandably reluctant to assume responsibility for a "reform" that might include
protective tariffs, a state tobacco monopoly, nationalization of railways, and
reduction of the budgetary power of the Reichstag.59 So Camphausen procrastinated. The only tax bill Bismarck received while at Varzin came from
Hofmann—for an increase in the tobacco tax—and it fell far short of the
chancellor's intentions. In early December Lucius got the impression that Bismarck was biding his time, waiting for Camphausen and company to "suffer
the shipwreck" that would enable him to return to Berlin and form "a homogeneous cabinet and, if possible, a conservative Reichstag majority."60
In mid-December 1877 Bismarck began to set the stage for his return to
duty by sending an ultimatum to his Prussian colleagues. He directed Biilow
to inform Camphausen and Achenbach that his resumption of his tasks was
dependent upon new arrangements that would secure the "energetic and voluntary" cooperation of Prussian ministers and officials in imperial affairs. The
"more ideal attempt at an independent development of the Reich" had to be
regarded as a failure. Henceforth he would seek to extend the system of personal union by appointing Prussian ministers to imperial offices. The "vicepresidency" of the Prussian cabinet must be combined with the "vice-presidency of the Reich in internal affairs." "The representation of the imperial
chancellor (minus foreign affairs) must be identical at all times with the representation of the minister-president." ("Hofmann . . . is not weighty enough
for that and we should seek another acceptable position for him.") In order
to implement the constitutional powers of the Reich in railway affairs, the

had to do all of the "dirty work" while Bismarck reserved the right to intervene at any moment
and make the minister "superfluous."

Prussian "railway minister"6' or his deputy had to be appointed head of the
Imperial Railway Office. "In addition to tax reform and the completion of
those railways on the western border required for military purposes, the fulfillment of those clauses of the imperial constitution dealing with railway affairs is one of the tasks whose execution must be the condition for my lasting
return to office. If I cannot secure the adequate and spontaneous assistance of
all competent organs of the Prussian government for the execution of what is
recognized as necessary in these areas, I will, if my health permits, appear in
the next session of the Reichstag, but only in order to present publicly the
reasons for my definite retirement." To Biilow he denied that his purpose was
to force Camphausen's resignation. He would prefer to see the desired reforms
undertaken by his present colleagues. If that proved to be unattainable, then
he "wanted to leave."62
While the idea of personal union was old, the form that Bismarck gave it
at the end of 1877 was new. In 1876 he had talked of giving imperial "ministries" more "substance" by appointing imperial state secretaries as Prussian
ministers with portfolio.63 Yet this plan was never carried out, for Hofmann
and Biilow were Prussian ministers without portfolio. Now the chancellor
proposed to attack the problem via the opposite route. Henceforth he would
seek to extend the system of personal union by appointing Prussian ministers
to imperial offices. By this means he hoped to engage his Prussian colleagues
in imperial affairs and "smoke out" their particularism.64 "Prussia," he said,
"is in greater need of Germanization than Germany of Prussianization."65 The
Saxon envoy at Berlin, Oswald von Nostitz-Wallwitz, recognized another
aim: "By this route Bismarck will seek to attain for himself a privileged and
decisive position within the Prussian cabinet of the kind that he possesses as
chancellor in the empire."66
Bismarck also resolved to insist on two other related measures: the final
dissolution of the Reicfisicanzleramt as the prelude to personal union, and a
permanent system of deputization. In January 1878 he composed a long memorandum to the Kaiser in which he formally proposed the first of these steps.
As administered by Delbriick, he now tactfully admitted, the Reichskanzleramt
had proved a useful and indispensable "nursery" for the training of imperial
officials. But its growth had threatened the state governments, put their
ministers on the defensive, and led to their virtual withdrawal from the affairs
of the Bundesrat—with the consequence that "the empire is stranded."

To refloat it, he proposed to divide the Rekhskanzleramt into an Imperial Treasury {Rekhsschatzamt) and an "administrative office" (Verwakungsamt), from
which later an "office of commerce" might be separated. An imperial executive divided into departments would appear less formidable and more accessible to the counterpart ministries in the states, spurring their cooperation. In
particular, he expected a harmonious relationship to develop between the
Imperial Treasury and the Prussian Ministry of Finance, without which the
"basic reform of our tariff and tax system," the most pressing need of the
Reich, was impossible. Roon was his model. Although insistent on protecting
his prerogatives as Prussian minister of war, the general had effectively nourished the interests of the Reich. 6 '
The need for a permanent system of deputization had become apparent in
April 1877 when the progressives, particularly the political scientist Hanel,
attacked the deputization of Hofmann and Biilow as unconstitutional. Although he did not accept their interpretation of the constitution, Bismarck
came to appreciate the wisdom of clarifying the issue. He had more in mind
than merely the need to provide for future leaves of absence or incapacitation.
The expansion of administrative functions and the division of the Rekhskanzleramt into separate agencies had made it impossible for one individual, particularly one who was frequently sick, to exercise actual control over day-today operations of the imperial bureaucracy. Under these circumstances the
"responsibility" imposed on the chancellor under article 17 of the constitution had become fictional. In conjunction with the proposed final liquidation
of the Rekhskanzleramt, therefore, Bismarck proposed to establish a permanent system for delegating the chancellor's right of countersignature either to
a vice-chancellor or to individual state secretaries. Such an arrangement
would enable him to shift to subordinates some of the burdens of his position,
without sacrificing his own final authority. But it might also appease somewhat those liberals who charged that the business of state was suffering because the Reich lacked a cabinet. When deputized, imperial state secretaries
would have some of the attributes of ministers, but not the kind of independence enjoyed by members of the Prussian Collegium.68
The Bennigsen Candidacy
On April 6, 1877, at the height of the "chancellor crisis" Tiedemann recorded in his diary a startling remark by Bismarck: "In all questions that have
to do with personnel the Kaiser is difficult, but, when it comes to substituting
one person for another, he is almost impossible. When I proposed to him

recently that Bennigsen be made Prussian minister of interior, he looked at
me as though he were talking to a drunk."6» Once again Bismarck had conceived, in the spirit of Realpolitik, one of those tactical zigzags that Wilhelm's
linear mind could not follow. To Wilhelm the turn to a conservative policy
meant very simply the abandonment of the liberal alliance. But Bismarck was
not one to assume that men could not be brought to act against their interests
or, at least, to substitute a lesser for a greater interest. Had he not persuaded
Austria, for example, to cooperate against Denmark for objectives that were
more Prussian than Austrian? Until he had made the effort, he did not presume that liberals could not be seduced into cooperating with the government
for conservative purposes.
At the end of April he confided his intentions to Lucius. He was determined, he said, to insist on certain changes before resuming his duties: "I
can't carry Eulenburg any further and perhaps not Camphausen either." As a
Prussian minister Bennigsen "would at least offer the guarantee that we will
not lose the support of the liberal party, which we still need very much. . . .
It would be good if now some rulers succeed [to German thrones] who are not
overly strong and if the more important personalities would leave the Reichstag and enter the government. This will be the easiest way to accomplish the
consolidation of the Reich. I will not allow the weakening of the small states
and the Bundesrat."70 By bringing Bennigsen into the government he proposed, in other words, to gain the cooperation of national liberals for a reduction in the powers of the Reichstag.
Wilhelm's negative reaction did not deter Bismarck from wooing Bennigsen. In the past he had always been able to bring the monarch around to his
point of view at the crucial moment. In mid-July 1877 he invited Bennigsen
to Varzin for several days during which they sounded each other out on a
number of issues. In September they may have conferred again when Bismarck halted briefly in Berlin en route from Bad Gastein to Friedrichsruh. In
November Friedenthal acted as go-between in the continuing discussions. On
the day after Christmas Bennigsen was again at Varzin for a three-day visit,
which this time was widely publicized. At the end they agreed to talk again
on Bismarck's return to Berlin. We do not know exactly what was said on
these occasions. But they seem to have discussed Bismarck's plans for reorganizing the government, the need for new taxes to reduce the deficit in the
imperial budget, and the conditions for Bennigsen's entry into the cabinet.71
Apparently Bismarck offered Bennigsen the Prussian Ministry of Interior,
whose incumbent, Eulenburg, was in bad health and expected to retire, and

the vice-chancellorship of the empire, which was to be wrested from Hofmann. Bennigsen appreciated that this was a trap. As minister of interior, he
would have headed a conservative bureaucracy composed of tenured officials,
who would have limited his effectiveness. He preferred the Ministry of Finance which, in view of the coming budget crisis, was the most critical post
in the government. But he also realized that his influence even in this post
would be minimal without the support of at least one other minister from the
ranks of the national liberals. Hence he proposed as minister of interior Max
von Forckenbeck, president of the Reichstag, who, as a close associate of
Lasker, could also guarantee the unity of the National Liberal party. After
consultation with other party leaders, he added a third candidate, Baron Franz
von Stauffenberg, who would have headed the projected Imperial Treasury.
Bennigsen, furthermore, had no intention of helping Bismarck weaken the
Reichstag. While agreeing to increases in indirect taxation that would have
liquidated state assessments, he specified that the future taxes must be renewed each year. The budgetary power that parliament had unexpectedly
found after 1867 in the state assessments would be perpetuated in a new
guise.72 Even so, the negotiations of 1877 marked a major change in the tax
program of the National Liberal party. No longer did the party insist on direct
taxes (eine quotisierte Einkommensteuer) for the Reich. It abandoned that issue
to the progressives.73
Since the rebuff in March 1877 Bismarck had left Wilhelm uninformed
about his negotiations with Bennigsen. By the end of December, however,
rumors were rife in the German press; on December 29, the Norddeutsche
AUgemeine Zeitung carried the story of major changes to come in the Prussian
cabinet. To allay suspicion, Bismarck directed Count Lehndorff to give the
Kaiser "some information" about the "soundings" he had undertaken with
Bennigsen. In a letter dated December 30, Bismarck misled his sovereign by
intimating that the only subject discussed had been that of taxation. As a
result of the Bennigsen talks he anticipated, so he claimed, a favorable reception in the Reichstag for a general tax reform that would raise "large sums"
from new indirect taxes on tobacco, beer, and the like.74
This letter crossed one penned by Wilhelm on the same day. In it the Kaiser took the chancellor sharply to task for not informing his master of the
approaching "great upset" in the royal cabinet, about which the press seemed

me information on what is actually going on? Where Bennigsen is concerned,
I would not be able to respond trustingly to his entry into the cabinet, for,
talented though he is, he would not be able to follow the quiet and conservative course of my government that you yourself have told me so very decisively you intend to pursue." Opposite "follow" Bismarck wrote into the margin a single word that encapsulated his intentions with regard to the
Bennigsen candidacy: "doch" ("to the contrary").75
December had been a good month for Bismarck's health. During Bennigsen's visit, however, he contracted the grippe, now complicated by anger.
The Kaiser's letter, which arrived on New Year's Eve, cost him a sleepless
night marked by attacks of biliousness. Struck had to be summoned from Berlin to attend him. In a letter to Hohenlohe the prince complained that the
Kaiser's "lack of consideration" had irritated his nerves and delayed his recovery from "this insignificant cold."76 Nor was his condition improved by receipt
of a conciliatory letter from Wilhelm, who said that he now realized, after
hearing Lehndorff s report and reading Bismarck's letter of December 30, that
Bennigsen was "not a candidate."77 For three weeks the chancellor was confined to his room and bed, subject to painful and exhausting fits of coughing
and unable to sleep without opium. He lay there depressed and "pathologically sick with anger"78 at the thought that the Kaiser could write him a critical letter, even though the deception that the letter implied was true.
After the collapse of the "Bennigsen candidacy" liberal journalists and politicians—and in their wake historians—debated at length: whether the chancellor could have been sincere or whether the contact with Bennigsen had
not been from the start a conscious deception that had no other purpose than
to tantalize and mislead, and whether, assuming the offer was sincere, Bennigsen made a fatal mistake in not seizing the chance to participate in the
government and thereby gain the leverage with which to prolong the liberal
era now drawing to a close.79 There appears to be no good reason to assume
that Bismarck's overtures were insincere. Wilhelm's opposition was not insuperable, particularly at a time when Europe was involved in a major crisis in
foreign affairs. By threatening resignation Bismarck had often succeeded in
overcoming the ruler's resistance on critical issues because Wilhelm could not
do without him. To gain Bennigsen's consent, the prince was prepared to
make concessions. He would have yielded to the deputy's desire for the Ministry of Finance, and the two men were agreed that this ministry should be

closely linked to the projected Imperial Treasury. He probably described the
deputization statute to Bennigsen as a concession to the liberal demand for
responsible ministries. It is even possible, moreover, that he showed a willingness to grant yearly renewal of taxes as a substitute for the Reichstag's right
to establish the amount of the state assessments.80 What he could not concede
was the inclusion of Forckenbeck and Stauffenberg and the "change of system" that the appointment of three national liberal deputies would imply. His
aim was a ministerial parliament, not a parliamentary ministry.
Among some national liberals the news of the pourparlers aroused euphoric
expectations. In view of Wilhelm's advanced age and Bismarck's failing
health, perhaps their moment had actually come. At last Bismarck's need of
them appeared to outweigh their need of him. What they had vainly striven
for thirty years to achieve from outside the government might now be
achieved from within. At a parliamentary dinner on January 27, 1878, Bennigsen confided to Lucius his views on the strength of the liberal position.
The liberals held two trumps: "(1) The rising need for new money, which
cannot be satisfied without our help; (2) the approaching end in two years of
the Septennat. We sense how unpleasant it is for Bismarck to work with parliament as a power factor. He has only a superficial understanding of taxation
and domestic questions and exaggerates his influence on the legislature in
these matters. It could happen that he will be overwhelmed, if he does not
come to an understanding with parliament. . . . If an understanding is now
reached between parliament and government, a steady development will be
assured for the next twenty years; if not, incalculable complications could
ensue."81
How high the expectations of the national liberals soared during these
weeks can be seen in the reports of Bennigsen and Bamberger to the Reichstag's national liberal caucus on February 18, 1878. According to the south
German, left-liberal deputy Julius Holder—whose diary is the only account
we have of this important meeting—the two leaders described the disarray in
the Prussian and imperial executive bodies as "insufferable" and a "thorough
tax reform" as imperative. "For that reason a truly responsible government is
necessary, one in close touch with the Reichstag's majority." Bismarck himself, they declared, was aware of this necessity and had talked about it with
Bennigsen. Imperial ministries, the chancellor maintained, were unattainable because of "difficulties." As a substitute he had ordered the drafting of a
"deputization statute." "Something or other is to be attained in this direction.
The grant of new taxes must be kept in hand as a means of pressure not only
against the Bundesrat but also (as it appeared to me, at least according to the
sense of their remarks) against Bismarck and the Kaiser in order (briefly said)

parliamentary government, although never explicitly stated as the goal of the negotiation, was
what the participants in the meeting had in mind. In the caucus on Feb. 20 Holder made his
own aim explicit: "For parliamentary government, since the necessity of the matter is pushing us
in that direction." Ibid., p. 81. The conviction that Germany was on the verge of converting
from a mixed to a parliamentary system of government existed in every branch of the liberal
movement during 1877—1878, from the national liberal right to the progressive left. See S. E.

mon position on major issues.83 Yet the left wing of the National Liberal party
did not feel comfortable in this combination. Hence Forckenbeck, Lasker,
and their associates set about the task of rebuilding their relationship to Hanel
and the right wing of the Progressive party in the interest of a "partnership of
liberal parties, which [Forckenbeck] held at this moment to be required in

behalf of the continued development of freedom." Privately, Forckenbeck
hoped for collapse of the Bennigsen—Bismarck negotiations, which he presumed were a trap for liberals of his conviction, as indeed they were.84 Once
in the cabinet, Bennigsen and his associates would have faced the necessity
of either shedding or abiding by their convictions. The former course meant
capitulation, the latter resignation. His experiences with the national liberals
over more than a decade led Bismarck to gamble on their capitulation.
In his memoirs Bismarck wrote that Bennigsen's insistence on the appointments of Forckenbeck and Stauffenberg in their December 1877 talk at Varzin
left him with the "impression" that the negotiation had failed and that WiIhelm's sharply negative reaction had ended any further consideration of it.85
Yet Bill Bismarck, during a visit to Berlin on January 11, 1878, told Tiedemann: "The negotiations with Bennigsen are not at all to be regarded as having failed."86 During January-February 1878, Bismarck followed a double
course, unwilling to discard either option as long as benefit might be derived
from it or, to use his own words, to throw out muddy water until he had pure.
As long as the Bennigsen candidacy remained alive, Camphausen, out of anxiety over his own status, would be under pressure to supply the tax bills the
chancellor demanded of him. There was always the possibility, moreover,
that national liberals might drop their demands in their eagerness to "spring
into the ship and help steer."87 Even if they did not, their hopes and anticipations of power might be exploited to gain their cooperation in legislative
matters.
Bennigsen left Varzin with the impression that the negotiation would resume on Bismarck's return to Berlin.88 But Bismarck delayed his return, exploiting his relapse in health as an excuse. Through Herbert he indicated to
Bennigsen that press sensationalism and Eulenburg's intrigues at court had
antagonized Wilhelm and complicated his task.8» By January 18 his "good
humor" and "capacity for work" had returned; yet he clung to Varzin. In a
letter to Tiedemann Lucius described the consequences: "Neither Bundesrat
nor Reichstag will get its work under way until he is here, and the present
state of confusion is simply unbearable." Not until February 14 did the chancellor depart for Berlin impelled, to his great irritation, by the necessity of
answering an interpellation in the Reichstag concerning the Balkan crisis.90
He would have preferred to temporize even longer.

383

The Deputization Statute
The principal fruit of the Bennigsen negotiation was the deputization statute
passed in March 1878. The government's bill provided that the Kaiser, on the
proposal of the chancellor, could delegate the chancellor's duties and functions to one or more officials. While the deputized official had the right of
countersignature, he acted under the constitutional "responsibility" of the
chancellor, who retained the right to intervene at any moment and to reassert
his power of decision. In the debates on the deputization bill, progressives
seized the opportunity to renew their attacks on the Bismarck system. The
executive functions of the chancellor, they charged, had multiplied and diversified to the point that his "responsibility" was meaningless. Under "the
most powerful statesman that Germany had ever seen" contact between government and parliament had become "only accidental, irregular, and from
case to case." Only a parliamentary system, Hanel declared, could assure the
harmony between executive and majority that was essential for consistent
government. For the Kaiser and chancellor alone to decide who would be
deputized—and when—was "a kind of dictatorship."
In reply, Bismarck maintained that the Kaiser already possessed the power
to deputize and could exercise it even if the bill, which merely clarified the
procedure, were not passed. Again he disputed the practicability of a cabinet
system for the Reich and asserted that the new structure of the Reich executive, with its single responsible chancellor and multiple agencies, now approximated the English cabinet system. Again he teased the deputies with the
thought that, if they were patient, the new system might evolve in the direction they desired. In Bundesrat and Reichstag, delegates of the state governments reinforced his arguments, opposing a ministerial system in the Reich as
injurious to the federal principle. Bennigsen, seconded by Lasker, rejected
Hand's call for revolutionary changes in the governmental system. Still under
the illusion that he might enter the government, Bennigsen accepted the bill
as an important step in the right direction and carried his entire party with
him. National liberals, conservatives, and free conservatives combined to
pass the statute against centrists, progressives, and socialists.91 Bismarck's flirtation with Bennigsen had eased the passage of a major item in the chancellor's legislative program.
Another accomplishment was the "change in personnel" at which he had
aimed for months. As the Stosch affair showed, Wilhelm was not easily persuaded to dispense with the services of a minister or official to whom he had
grown accustomed, and, as his sharp reaction to Bennigsen's candidacy revealed, finding a replacement acceptable to him was equally difficult. Hence
Bismarck pushed for the execution of policies rather than dismissal of minis" SBR (1878), I, 321-348, 373-420, 431-441; RGB (1878), pp. 7-8. On the drafting of the

ters.» After the ultimatum delivered through Biilow in December, he pressed
Camphausen and Achenbach relentlessly to produce those bills on financial
and railway affairs that he had declared to be the condition of his continuance
in office. Camphausen, besieged in recent months by anxiety about the se­
curity of his position, was flattered by the thought that Bismarck's new policy
of bringing Prussian ministries into imperial affairs heightened his own im­
portance. Yet he was troubled by the realization that Bismarck's aim was a
finance reform that would reduce the power of the Reichstag, an objective
contrary to his liberal convictions and likely to alienate liberal allies in parlia­
ment. 9 3 He also realized that one of the financial measures upon which Bis­
marck was most insistent, a state tobacco monopoly, was for him political
dynamite, since most liberals opposed it. Yet new income had to be found if
the growth in imperial expenditures (up 25 percent since 1872) was not to be
covered by increased state assessments. Earlier surpluses with which the Reich
had balanced its budget in 1875 and 1876 were exhausted. Camphausen
sought to escape from this dilemma by proposing not the tobacco monopoly,
but a large increase in the tobacco tax and a new stamp tax on securities,
Lombard loans, business contracts, and lottery tickets. Ironically this "middle
course" was the same taken by his predecessor Heydt in 1869. And as in
Heydt's case it led straight to disaster.94
Since Heydt's failure the "bourse tax," as the second of these levies was
commonly called, had been repeatedly resurrected and rejected. It was fa­
vored by agrarians in the House of Lords as a means of equalizing the tax
burden and was opposed naturally by the business community. As in 1869
left-wing national liberals, led by Lasker and Stauffenberg, insisted in the
Reichstag debate on February 22, 1878, that the grant of new imperial taxes
must be part of a general tax reform and include guarantees for parliament's
budget power. Camphausen tried to cope with his critics by describing the
difficulties that lay in the way of a tobacco monopoly. But Bismarck undercut
him, saying outright that he favored the monopoly and considered the to­
bacco tax increase to be but a transitional stage toward it. Bismarck's dis­
avowal of Camphausen created consternation in the chamber. It was, Lasker
judged, the most dramatic and suspenseful parliamentary session he had ever
attended. 95
Camphausen should have resigned that evening, but he could not bring

himself to abandon the post he had held for nearly a decade. Next day (February 23) he tried to erase the impression that he and the chancellor were at
odds by quoting a memorandum he had written in February 1877 favoring the
monopoly in principle. That brought him the satisfaction of hearing Bismarck
praise his professional competence, "firmness of character," and "decisiveness." He hoped, Bismarck said, to continue with Camphausen "on the same
path further than I could have foreseen a few years ago." The two men shook
hands, Camphausen tearfully, in full view of the astonished chamber.»6 By
clinging to his position "like a drowning man to a straw," Camphausen ruined
his relationship to the liberals (even Bennigsen was firmly opposed to a tobacco monopoly), without whose support he had publicly declared he could
not remain in office. After watching the Reichstag reject all of his bills, except for an insignificant levy on playing cards, the minister finally resigned.97
On February 22-23 Bismarck demonstrated how to slaughter a colleague
without being charged with murder. He put Camphausen's head on a block,
but liberals wielded the axe. Camphausen was not the only victim. In view of
his opposition to the tobacco monopoly, Bennigsen terminated his candidacy
for the cabinet.98 (Bismarck never had to tell him that he was no longer under
consideration.) Achenbach, whom Bismarck had denounced to the Chamber
of Deputies on March 23 for "passive resistance" on railway reform, also resigned." By coincidence still another ministry became vacant. Eulenburg,
long at odds with Bismarck and in bad health, resigned in March at the end
of a six-month leave. Since the Landtag approved Bismarck's request that the
vice-presidency of the cabinet, hitherto coupled with the Finance Ministry,
be made into an independent, salaried position, the prince now had four positions to fill in his search for his "homogeneous cabinet."100 At his parliamentary soiree on March 23, he remarked, "In large states like Prussia and
Germany it is not so important whether a cabinet is inclined either to the
right or left on different questions, for the legislature will compensate. It is
much more important that the government proceed in one direction. If six
horses are harnessed to the wagon, they must all obey one will or never go
forward."101
Bismarck now had the opportunity to select four new horses. His first
choice was Count Otto zu Stolberg-Wernigerode, who had proved his capacity as an administrator in Hanover after its annexation and been rewarded
with the embassy in Vienna. Stolberg became Bismarck's chief deputy in do96

mestic affairs as vice-president of the Prussian cabinet and vice-chancellor of
the Reich. The new minister of interior was Count Botho zu Eulenburg, a
career Prussian official and cousin of the departed minister (Count Friedrich
zu Eulenburg). Albert Maybach, former president of the Imperial Railway Office and an ardent advocate of public ownership or regulation of railways,
assumed the Ministry of Commerce. But the critical post was the Ministry of
Finance, and no qualified person, it appeared, wanted to succeed Camphausen. After nine or more refusals (including Bennigsen and possibly DeIbruck!), Tiedemann proposed in desperation a candidate no one had thought
of because he was so little qualified—Arthur Hobrecht, the national liberal
lord mayor of Berlin.I02
During the period of the "Bennigsen candidacy," Heinrich von Treitschke
wrote to Gustav Freytag, "Bismarck cannot tolerate independent characters
near him, and I advise no friend of mine to put his head in the noose."103
Rudolf Virchow told the Chamber of Deputies, "The minister-president is
said . . . to be an iron man who can put anything across, and yet he presents
himself in parliament as the weakest of all, as though he were utterly unable
to direct even the smallest of his colleagues to do what the state's situation
and politics demand." But this was mere theater, which masked the injuries
the chancellor inflicted by his penchant for "ruining" those who worked with
him. "One after the other is brought down, not only kicked out but also showered afterward with spite and contempt. The number of personalities willing
to offer themselves as possible ministers is becoming steadily smaller. Obviously we are facing a complete bankruptcy of personalities in the German
Reich."10··
What Treitschke, the national liberal, and Virchow, the progressive, saw
from a distance Lucius, the free conservative, observed close up. "The inclination to blow every petty matter up into a conflict is almost pathological and
leads to constant frictions. In view of his nerves he can preserve himself for
the Reich and the state only if he relinquishes a large part of his activity and
allows some room for independent personalities working with him. In quiet
moments he sees that himself and is resolved to permit it."105 But Bismarck's
quiet moments were few, and by mid-June 1878 Lucius was shocked to find
him already complaining about all of his new colleagues except Maybach.
"Hobrecht is a groveler, who always seeks contact with the national liberals.
Botho Eulenburg is a state's attorney, who can always cite six statutes to explain why something cannot be done. Stolberg complains about having nothing to do, although he can order everything laid before him." In October

Lucius reported, "He is again unrestrained in talking about ministerial colleagues and is somewhat unjust to them. At least Count Stolberg and [Botho]
Eulenburg, who entered the cabinet with great reluctance, do not deserve his
displeasure."106
With the "Bennigsen candidacy" Bismarck and the national liberals entered a critical stage in their relationship. Once the courtship was over, both
sides found reasons why it was a poor match. The prince was dismayed to
discover that Bennigsen was not a statesman, but just another "institutional
doctrinaire," who lacked the "independence" to enter the government alone
and was too much under Lasker's influence.IO? Bennigsen and his associates,
on the other hand, felt relieved to be rid of temptation. "We all said: thank
God!" reported Eduard Stephani.1"8 Bennigsen began to see how unrealistic
his prospects had been. "I can congratulate myself and my friends on having
gotten safely out of this affair. In view of Bismarck's present nervousness and
the irrational way in which he has recently conducted business and handled
political parties, it would not have been possible to get along with him for as
much as half a year."109 Having rejected Bismarck's caress, the national liberals were wary of his foot. They began to prepare for a dissolution of the
Reichstag.
Nevertheless, they decided against "systematic opposition," resolving to
consider each issue on its merits.110 Hence they accepted the deputization
statute, but stood firm against the government's tax program and plan to reorganize Prussian ministries. On March 2, 1878, the chancellor twisted the
arms of Bennigsen and Forckenbeck in favor of the tobacco monopoly, beginning with "inducements" (did he again offer Bennigsen a ministry?) and ending with "threats" (he would dissolve the Reichstag and, "if necessary," govern without it; the military conventions between Prussia and the other states
would be adequate to secure the power of the Reich). 11 ' At the end of the
month he told Kardorff that a dissolution was "unavoidable," for he could not
govern with a Reichstag that refused funds and was dominated by ideologues. II2 But then he appears to have reverted to an earlier opinion—that it

would do no good to dissolve over the tax issue. "We must now draft an economic program and seek to imprint it on the consciousness of the voters—
then, after a year and a half, it will be possible to vote on economic, not
political, issues."113 Julius Holder was right to suspect "fire in the attic."114
Reorganizing the Reich Executive
Passage of the deputization act in March 1878 expedited the final dissolution
of the Imperial Chancellor's Office (Reichskanzleramt). In May was established
the Imperial Chancellery (Reichskanzlei), the chancellor's personal secretariat, whose first chief was Tiedemann. In 1879, the two remaining divisions of
the Reichskanzleramt were renamed the Imperial Treasury (Reichsschatzamt)
and the Imperial Office of the Interior (Reichsamt des lnnem). The problem of
what to do with Hofmann was solved when he agreed to head the latter
agency in combination with the Prussian Ministry of Commerce. The separate agencies of the Reich were now eight: foreign office, admiralty, post and
telegraph, Alsace-Lorraine, railway office, judicial office, treasury, interior
office. The Reichskanzlei, consisting of only three, later four officials, was the
channel through which the chancellor communicated with heads of the seven
agencies dealing with domestic affairs; the state secretary of the foreign office
reported directly to the chancellor. Bismarck's extended absences from Berlin
made the chancellery an important agency, but it never achieved the status
of the old Reichskanzleramt·, nor did its chief attain the power Delbriick had
enjoyed."5
Bismarck's plans for restructuring the Prussian ministries ran into trouble
in the Landtag at the hands of centrists, progressives, and national liberals.
All were generally resentful over the bill's form (a supplement to the budget),
the haste with which the chamber was expected to pass it, and the absence of
a finance minster to defend it. In December 1878 the national liberals, shaken
by recent experiences, changed sides and passed a revised bill. ll6 Yet the lesser
states grumbled at the "personal union" for which these measures were intended to lay the groundwork. They feared "conflicts of interest" and the
"open Prussian hegemony" that would result if Prussian ministers with portfolio should act simultaneously as chiefs of imperial agencies, Prussian delegates to the Bundesrat, and countersigning deputies of the chancellor.117

structed control over the executive branches of the German and Prussian governments. For that reason he became less interested in structural changes that
might have made a more efficient instrument of government out of the ungainly machine he had fashioned in 1866-1867. During the years that followed he continued to shift gears from time to time, but without attaining a
clear and lasting solution to the problem of coordination between the Reich
and Prussia that was to be one of his unfortunate legacies. In early 1879 he
returned to a policy of accentuating the importance of the Reich administration by initiating "regular conferences" among heads of the imperial agencies
to establish "common principles of policy"—but only two were held. At the
second meeting (April 9, 1879) he announced his intention to establish a
sharper separation between the Prussian and imperial executive bodies, ordering that "presidential bills" (that is, those prepared in imperial agencies)
be sent directly to the Bundesrat without prior approval by the pertinent Prussian ministers. At the same time he reasserted his right as Prussian foreign
minister to instruct the votes of Prussian representatives in the Bundesrat and
to monitor all communications between the Prussian and German governments." 8 This new emphasis upon the Reich executive at the cost of the
Prussian cabinet can also be seen in his appointment of Hofmann as Prussian
minister of commerce (March 1879). Maybach, who now became minister of
public works (Bismarck's new "railway ministry"), did not combine that post
with the presidency of the Imperial Railway Office. Friedberg, moreover, was
not permitted to remain chief of the Reich Office of Justice when he became
Prussian minister of justice, on the grounds that this would constitute a "mediatization of the Reich."1'9 Evidently Bismarck now considered the accumulation of offices through personal union hazardous both to the principle of
federalism and to his own personal power as the holder of the constitutional
balance.
Where governmental relationships were concerned, Bismarck shifted constantly from one expedient to another, unable to find an adequate and lasting
structure. His attempts along the way to explain and elucidate legal and constitutional relationships were often contradictory. He was consistent only in
his unceasing quest to heighten his own authority by juggling persons, offices,
parties, and governments. In this he was driven by a narcissistic quest for
personal power, by enduring uneasiness about the solidity of the German social and political order, and by his continuing search for the means with
which to advance its consolidation. About the realities of the dangers he
sensed there can be no doubt. That those dangers ultimately materialized was

owing not only to their evolutionary force but also to the limitation of Bismarck's own vision. He left Germany with a governmental machine whose
cogs and wheels were poorly meshed, of whose working relationships he himself was never clear—a machine that was increasingly oriented toward the
satisfaction of his own need to dominate and control.

The Antisocialist Statute

/6YSj^)NE OF BISMARCK'S more than four hundred guests at a parliamen7¾¾¾¾ tary soiree in March 1878 described him as he was at age sixtyoV-^~y) three. "The prince's hair is almost white, his face reddish, but his
X>- y corpulence is especially evident. He was the bulkiest man in the
gathering, although others were not lacking in embonpoints. When talking,
the prince is often noticeably afflicted by a nervous sweat. He also appears to
suffer from an asthmatic condition; at times he stops talking in order to take
a deep breath. Unfortunately our chancellor is not healthy. Willpower alone
permits him to surmount his suffering and fulfill the difficult tasks of his high
office."1 That evening, while guzzling Munich beer in "the genuine student
manner," Bismarck asked a guest for advice on how to get rid of podagra and
take off weight. "I'm becoming so fat that I have to purchase new uniforms
and wardrobe every year."2 Between 1874 and 1879 Bismarck's weight increased by 45 lbs. (227 to 272).3
Physically Bismarck profited little from the ten months' leave of 18771878. In February and March 1878 weakness compelled him to sit during his
longer speeches in parliament, and once he had to break off before finishing.4
The foreign policy speech of February 19, in which he depicted himself as
Europe's "honest broker," was rhetorically one of his best performances, although extemporaneous. Later he said that he had been nearly overcome by
exhaustion—"the heads [of the deputies] seemed like black points." That evening he could neither eat nor sleep. Next day, when Lucius came to dinner,
his appetite was back: "He devoured half of a turkey-hen, slicing everything
himself with his knife, and drank one-quarter to one-half of a bottle of cognac
mixed with two to three bottles of Apollinaris. During the day he enjoys neither beer nor champagne; cognac mixed with water suits him best. He insisted
that I drink with him so that he couldn't tell how much he consumed. There
is concern that his dietary mistakes could suddenly lead to a stroke."5 On

March 27, he confessed to the Chamber of Deputies that he could work but a
few hours a day and was compelled to curtail contacts with other ministers.
Yet he complained bitterly that people treated him like a "basically healthy
person, of whom everything was expected that an active and healthy person
can accomplish by day and night." His was a "thankless profession."6
Two visitors found Bismarck in a resentful and cynical mood at this time.
His services to the state, he grumbled to Busch, had robbed him of his health.
"People should be grateful to me for this, instead of electing to the Reichstag
men of vanity and ingratitude."7 To Lucius he spoke of "envy and conceit"
and told the fable about a man who was promised the fulfillment of any wish—
with one condition: his most bitter enemy would receive double the same.
The man's wish was to go blind in one eye. "One of Bismarck's more notable
characteristics," Lucius reflected, "is the tendency to harbor deep thoughts of
revenge or retaliation for injustices he has suffered or presumes to have suffered. In his pathological excitability he conceives many things to be unjust
that others probably do not intend to be such." Lucius could see why a capable
person like Stolberg would hesitate to join Bismarck's government. The
"abruptness and violence" with which business was transacted kept "tranquil
and rational persons" from working with the chancellor.8
In April 1878, Bismarck planned to spend two weeks in Friedrichsruh, but
his departure was delayed until April 17 by an attack of rheumatism. Three
days after arriving in the Sachsenwald, he fell ill of shingles, and Dr. Struck
had to be summoned from Berlin.9 On May 6, the forestry expert, John
Booth, found him able to walk in the woods to inspect new plantings but very
weak and unable to stand for long. That evening at dinner the prince was
abnormally quiet, talking mostly to his physician about his health and what
could be done to deaden the neuralgia that returned each night to plague
him.IO While still in this convalescent condition, he received shocking news
from Berlin that required a new burst of activity. Suddenly the new era in
German politics toward which he had been groping since 1875 seemed attainable.

Hodel and Nobiling
On the afternoon of May 11, 1878, a worker named Max Hodel fired three
shots from a revolver on the avenue Unter den Linden as Kaiser Wilhelm and
his daughter, the Grand Duchess of Baden, rode by in an open carriage. Nei6

ther was hit, and Hodel was apprehended while running from the scene. Less
than three weeks later, on June 2, the Kaiser, while riding on the same avenue, was struck by two shotgun blasts from a second story window. This time
his assailant was Karl Nobiling, Ph.D., who shot himself in the head before
being arrested. Wilhelm was driven to the palace, bleeding profusely from
pellet wounds in the cheek, throat, shoulder, and hand. "I do not understand," he sighed, "why I'm always being shot at."" Though painful, his injuries would not have been serious except for his age (eighty-one). Hodel was
tried, condemned, and executed on August 19, while Nobiling succumbed of
his wounds on September 10.
Hodel and Nobiling were psychopaths eager for attention and notoriety—
a type known all too well in recent history. Both may have been syphilitic. A
twenty-year-old journeyman tinsmith from Dresden, Hodel had a long record
of petty crime. It is not certain that he aimed to kill, and his deed may (his
explanations were inconsistent) have been purely demonstrative, intended to
dramatize either himself or, as he claimed, the fate of the poor. Nobiling had
studied agriculture and economics at the universities of Halle and Leipzig. At
the age of thirty he was professionally unsuccessful. His father had died a
suicide, and one of his brothers had a criminal record. It was difficult to obtain
testimony from either man, Hodel because of his imbecility and Nobiling because his head wound left him seldom lucid. There was no evidence that the
two men knew each other or that either had coconspirators.
The news of these crimes sent shock waves through the German press and
public and aroused general indignation. To many they were proof of a widespread conspiracy against the monarchy and the prevailing social order; others
believed that they were at least influenced by the poisonous atmosphere produced by socialist agitation. That the German socialist movement, like Karl
Marx, eschewed individual acts of violence as counterproductive to their
goals was disregarded or disbelieved. The conspiracy thesis was reinforced by
Hermann Tessendorff, the red-baiting state's attorney, who investigated both
cases and generally suppressed evidence that did not fit the theory that Hodel
and Nobiling had socialist connections. Hodel had once belonged to the Social Democratic party in Leipzig and had sold subscriptions to party journals
and distributed its literature. But he had been expelled from the party on a
charge of embezzlement. Later he signed up with the Anarchist League and
with the new Christian Social Labor party of court preacher Adolf Stocker,
both deadly enemies of the social democrats. Although he had expressed some
socialist views in early years, Nobiling had most recently presented himself as
a national liberal and attended socialist meetings only to heckle speakers. In
one of his few coherent moments he explained that he had wanted to remove

Wilhelm in order that Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm, who was "more independent and less easily influenced," could ascend the throne.12 The readiness of the public to believe that the deeds of two madmen were proof of a
socialist conspiracy is evidence of the growing social tensions and fears produced by five years of economic depression, the growth of socialist agitation,
and recent successes of the Social Democratic party at the polls. The mood of
the country can be seen in the following account, written by a socialist, of
what happened on the evening of May n in the provincial city of Halle,
when news arrived of Hodel's act: "Thousands of people poured into the
streets and wandered about; the marketplace was a wildly simmering, bubbling kettle full of excited people. Some prayed, others sang, 'Nun danket aiie
Gott.' Many did not yet know the details of the attempted assassination and
kept asking, 'Is he dead? Is he dead?' Bells rang from all churches, and many
persons ran about bareheaded, as though out of their minds, knocking the
hats off of others in a blind rage." Persons emerging from a restaurant known
to be a meeting place for radicals were attacked by a frenzied crowd, which
continued for days to roam the streets.I3
At Friedrichsruh Bismarck received the news of Hodel's shots within an
hour after the event. That evening in Berlin, as Tiedemann drafted a report
on a socialist conspiracy based on testimony from an unreliable informer,I4 a
telegram arrived from Friedrichsruh asking, "Should we not use the attempted
assassination as grounds for immediately presenting a bill against the socialists
and their press?" Two days later, as the Prussian cabinet debated the issue,
Herbert brought another message from Friedrichsruh. "Our duty and obligation to the country require that we at least attempt to seek remedy through
legislation. If the legislature hampers us in this, we have at least discharged
our duty. . . . If the Reichstag refuses to assist the government in suppressing
social democracy, we must renew the effort in the next session. At any rate it
would be advantageous in the next election, if the Reichstag were compelled,
in view of the attempted assassination, to take a position with regard to a bill
against socialist subversion."15 Since the collapse of the Bennigsen candidacy,
Bismarck had been considering the dissolution of the Reichstag. Now Hodel
had provided him with a superb issue on which to fight the election that
would follow.

The issue was not new, although it had taken a dramatically new turn.
During the winter of 1875-1876 the government had sought and failed to gain
passage of an amendment to the penal code that would have permitted the
fining and imprisonment of persons threatening the public peace by stimulating class conflict or by attacking the institutions of marriage, family, and
property. On that occasion, too, Bismarck's purpose had been to force the
Reichstag to take a position on the problem of subversion. In 1878, however,
Bismarck's first obstacle was not the Reichstag but the cabinet. Friedenthal
and Leonhardt were outspoken in their opposition to Bismarck's proposal. But
Hobrecht, FaIk, and Eulenburg also doubted the wisdom of proposing an exceptional law against socialists. They expected the Reichstag to reject the bill
and preferred a more intensive use of existing laws to combat subversion.
Friedenthal carried their views to Friedrichsruh, but "as usual" drew the
shorter end of the argument. "The prince . . . firmly insisted that the socialdemocratic movement can be effectively combatted only if we gain the right
to surmount the barriers established in the so-called civil rights clauses of the
constitution out of excessive concern for the protection of individuals and
political parties. The state finds itself in a state of emergency vis-a-vis socialists. In an emergency one cannot be hypersensitive about methods—a corsaire
corsaire et demil"16

On May 16, Botho Eulenburg, after a roundtrip to Friedrichsruh, gave the
cabinet the draft of an "exceptional law," whose presentation to parliament
the chancellor declared to be the government's "unavoidable duty." It provided that the Bundesrat be empowered to suppress "publications and organizations that pursue the aims of social democracy," subject to later approval
by the Reichstag; that local police be authorized to dissolve socialist meetings
and forbid distribution of socialist literature in public places; and that participants in forbidden clubs and meetings be imprisoned. Faced with this ultimatum from Friedrichsruh, only Hobrecht clung to his objections.17 Without
a formal ballot the bill was dispatched to the Bundesrat, which approved it
on May 17 over minor opposition (Bremen and Hamburg).18 In the Reichs,6

Other governments had doubts about the bill but voted for it. Schumer, Entstehungsgeschichte, pp. 33-34. For the bill see SBR (1878), IV, No. 274. Bismarck instructed Hofmann to
tell the Reichstag that the issue of socialist subversion was not new. Hodel's deed had merely
reaffirmed the necessity of legislative action to strengthen the powers of the state. The new bill
was merely another such effort, like the penal code act of 1875, whose "rubber paragraphs" Lasker
and the left-liberals had excoriated. Tiedemann to Hofmann, May 19, 1878. DZA Potsdam,

tag, however, the steamroller broke down. At a caucus on May 21 the national liberals divided over the issue. Again Bennigsen's gift for compromise
filled the breach. The caucus agreed to oppose the bill, but left open the
possibility for other legislation.I9
In the chamber Bennigsen shouldered the responsibility for explicating the
party's position. Like the government, he insisted, liberals appreciated the
danger posed by growing socialist agitation and the necessity of taking action
against excesses committed by the movement. What they objected to was the
desire of the government to proceed on the basis of an exceptional rather than
common law. Many of the "aims" that the law was intended to proscribe were
shared by nonsocialist scholars and "humane legislators" insofar as they concerned general improvement in working class conditions. Exceptional laws
like the Carlsbad decrees had done little to prevent the spread of subversive
ideas but merely poisoned the relationship between government and people.
The "dictatorial power" demanded by the government would only arouse
sympathy for its victims. At no time since its creation, furthermore, had the
German government appeared less capable of exercising such a power. "The
important man who, as minister-president of Prussia, stands at the head of
the responsible government and who, as chancellor, is alone responsible for
the affairs of the German Reich has not been well for a long time. Despite
great effort and self-sacrificing devotion to duty, he has not been able as a
consequence of his health to conduct more than part of the business that is
entrusted to him by law and the constitution. . . . I am sorry to have to say
it, but I cannot avoid stating that in Prussia the ministerial crisis is permanent." On May 24 the two conservative parties alone voted for the bill, which
was overwhelmingly defeated (251 to 57).2°
Tiedemann, who meanwhile had been summoned to Friedrichsruh, was
astonished at Bismarck's "indifference" to the news of this defeat. "When the
Reichstag majority disturbs his plans, he usually does not lack caustic remarks
in airing his displeasure. But this time he limited himself to a few joking remarks about the unfortunate ministers whose duty it had been to defend the
ill-fated bill. Whether he would have been so indifferent if he had himself
been compelled to stand in the breach during the fight is another matter.
Obviously he believes the fruit is not yet ripe enough to be shaken from the
tree and that public opinion must be given time to prepare itself for further,
more far-reaching measures. There was no talk of dissolving the Reichstag as
an answer to the abrupt rejection of the bill." Perhaps, Tiedemann speculated, information received on May 21 had had a calming effect on the

prince's ego: Russia had agreed to meet the other powers in Berlin to search
for a peaceful settlement of the Balkan crisis. Although unburdened by the
"mortgage of conceit," Bismarck took satisfaction in knowing that he was
shortly to be the arbiter of Europe.21
When the telegraph reported Nobiling's attack on June 2, Bismarck, his
health improving daily, was walking in the woods with two newly acquired
dogs, Tyras and Rebecca. Tiedemann found him returning across an open
field. The prince was in a good mood; the forest air, he said, had soothed his
nerves. When he paused, Tiedemann told him briefly that the Kaiser had
been shot and "severely wounded." "The prince halted abruptly. He drove his
oaken walking stick into the dirt with a heavy thrust and, breathing deeply as
though struck by a flash of inspiration, said, 'Then we will dissolve the
Reichstag!' " Only then did he ask for details. With quickened step the two
men hurried home, where Bismarck ordered preparations for the return to
Berlin on the following morning. During the journey on June 3, it became
evident what fantasies Nobiling's deed had aroused throughout Germany. At
each station, the train was met by excited crowds bearing the "wildest and
most unbelievable rumors": the crown prince had been fired on; Prince Friedrich Karl was wounded; mines had been discovered under the royal palace. By
the time they reached Berlin, Bismarck was sufficiently alarmed to dispatch
Tiedemann to inquire of Minister of War Kameke whether steps had been
taken to strengthen the Berlin garrison against insurrection. That evening the
chancellor spent a few minutes with the Kaiser, who was cheerful but indignant at being the target of shotgun pellets rather than an "honorable bullet."
For a monarch to be hunted down like a rabbit or pheasant was humiliating.22

Dissolution of the Reichstag
In the summer of 1878 Bismarck reached another peak in his reputation as
Europe's greatest diplomatist. For one month (June 13 to July 13) Berlin was
Europe's capital, as statesmen of the great powers strove under his "honest
brokerage" to resolve their differences over the Balkans without war. In foreign affairs his talents seemed indispensable to Germany and even Europe. At
the same time, his reputation for effective statesmanship in domestic affairs
touched bottom. To competent observers of widely disparate political convictions, it appeared that the governmental machine was breaking down. Years
of depression had brought social distress to a dangerous level; workers were
restive and bourgeois fearful; a crisis loomed in public finance. The man
" Tiedemann, Sechs]ahre, pp. 265-266.
" Ibid., pp. 266-270. On May 17, 1878, Tiedemann reported to Bleichroder that the prince's
health was improving "day by day"; although diminishing, the neuralgia was still evident and
likewise its consequence—sleeplessness. Bleichroder Archive, Kress Library of Business and Economics, Harvard, Box I, Folder 14.

whose primary responsibility it was to master these problems was perennially
sick, usually absent from Berlin, and able to spend at best only a few hours a
day on public business. He was, furthermore, often out of touch with his colleagues in the Prussian cabinet. His attacks upon them in the press and in
parliament had created a seemingly permanent ministerial crisis. To find qualified replacements for them had become increasingly difficult. The chancellor
appeared unable to make the complicated machinery of the Prussian-German
state operate effectively, although it was his own design. His chief solution to
the problem was authoritarian—to heighten his own power at the cost of his
colleagues and of parliament.
Under these circumstances even right-wing liberals were willing to consider
whether the machine required reconstruction, whether a parliamentary democracy could achieve new efficiency and momentum by bringing fresh blood
into the government and closing the gap between the Reichstag and imperial
executive. To be sure, the octogenarian Hohenzoller who sat on the dual
thrones of Prussia and the Reich seemed blissfully unaware of the internal
crisis of his regime and more attached than ever to the man who had steered
him past the reefs and shoals of the 1860s to a preeminent position in Germany and Europe. But Wilhelm's time seemed short and, given his physical
condition, perhaps Bismarck's as well. Furthermore, the growing fiscal crisis
and the need for new taxes seemed to provide liberals with the means of coercion necessary to bring about constitutional reform. At this moment came
the shots of Hodel and Nobiling. For days stunned opponents could only mutter, "That Bismarck has incredible luck [Schweinegluck]."*3
Tiedemann's account of the scene that afternoon in the field at Friedrichsruh has often been analyzed for what it reveals about the chancellor's character and purposes. After hearing only the bare fact that the Kaiser had been
wounded, he made instantaneously the crucial decision to dissolve the
Reichstag. At that moment he did not know the identity of the assassin, the
nature of the man's political connections, or even the extent of Wilhelm's
injury. That he thought of politics first and of Wilhelm second was characteristic, but not necessarily proof of cold-blooded indifference.24 On June 3 he
paid his "liege lord" a brief visit, and, on leaving the room where the dignified
old man lay swathed in bandages, unable to speak or sign his name, the iron
chancellor stood for a time in a window niche and wept. On the following
day Baroness Spitzemberg found him still visibly shaken.25 There is no reason

to doubt the depth of Bismarck's concern at the time about the twin problems
of social distress and subversion. The sources show that he had never completely lost sight of the social question since his talks with Wagener and Lassalle in 1862-1863 and that his concern increased after 1871. Furthermore,
his solution had been consistently dual: social reform and police repression.z6
Still, it is undeniable that the first thought that raced through his mind in the
meadow at Friedrichsruh was how to exploit the incident against left-wing
liberals. For weeks he had wrestled with the problem of how to gain a majority
in the Reichstag more amenable to his wishes on the matter of new taxes.
Suddenly the opportunity was there. "Now I have the rascals where I want
them!" the chancellor is said to have exulted. "Does your highness mean the
social democrats?" he was asked. "No! The national liberals!"*7
Characteristically, Bismarck opened the cabinet meeting on June 4—the
first since Nobiling's attack—with remarks about his own health. His condition, he said, was still too poor to allow the full resumption of his duties. In
May, the Reichstag majority's declaration of no confidence in the government during the debate on the antisocialist bill had caused him again to consider resigning. But retirement was no longer possible in view of Nobiling's
attack. Required was a new and more far-reaching exceptional law, including
provisions for "protection of property, marriage, and family" (similar to those
proposed earlier in the so-called "rubber paragraph," authority to ban socialists from certain places and districts and to intern them, and denial of their
right to possess and bear arms without permission from the police. Finally, he
favored immediate dissolution of the Reichstag in order to exploit public indignation over Nobiling's deed and because the National Liberal party had
withdrawn its trust in the government. But he would, he declared, accept the
will of the cabinet majority if the ministers wished to attempt this legislation
with the existing parliament. When it became apparent, however, that indeed the majority did favor the latter course, Bismarck adjourned the meeting, ostensibly to await the arrival of Count Stolberg, the cabinet's new vicepresident, and to consult with the Kaiser or crown prince. Next day only
Friedenthal, Eulenburg, and Hobrecht still argued against immediate dissolution; collegial procedure, nevertheless, permitted Bismarck to present that
course to the crown prince as the will of the entire cabinet.28 He had to

"wring" the antisocialist bill out of his colleagues, he complained later to
Lucius.29
The ministers opposed to dissolution argued that it was unnecessary because the existing Reichstag, shaken by Nobiling's attack, would now readily
approve the antisocialist bill if reintroduced. Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm, upon whom the final decision rested, tended to share this opinion.
Friedrich Wilhelm had hurried home from England on hearing the news of
Nobiling's attack, expecting perhaps to govern as regent during his father's
incapacitation. But Wilhelm's injuries did not justify a regency, and the Kaiser directed, probably on Bismarck's advice, that his son be appointed deputy
(Stellvertreter), a status that he had himself once held during the incapacitation of Friedrich Wilhelm IV. Although he accepted this role, the crown
prince was deeply offended that Bismarck had not summoned him to participate in the audience on June 4, in which the decision was reached. An unpleasant confrontation occurred in which, according to one account, the
crown prince reminded Bismarck "to take heed of whom he was addressing."
Yet Friedrich Wilhelm approved the Reichstag's dissolution in a meeting of
the Crown Council on June 5. Although opposed to capital punishment, he
also signed the death warrant for Hodel.3° Once he had defended the dignity
of his position, Friedrich Wilhelm, like his father on so many occasions,
yielded to Bismarck's will. Much had happened since his act of defiance in
1863; evidently he was no longer capable, at least under these circumstances,
of precipitating an open breach with "that man."
Under the constitution the Bundesrat had the power to dissolve the Reichstag on the motion of the Kaiser (or his deputy). Like most Prussian ministers,
some ministers of other state governments (including Bavaria and Baden)
doubted the necessity of dissolution. Bismarck raised the issue to the level of
a vote of confidence in his leadership. Before resigning, so he told the Bavarian government, he would as his last official act advise the Kaiser to declare
martial law over an area "yet to be determined." For Prussia to be in the
minority on this issue, moreover, would demonstrate the necessity of revising
the imperial constitution—with obvious consequences for the federal system.
The consequences of a defeat on the issue of dissolution in the Bundesrat
would, he hinted darkly to the government of Baden, affect "individual governments" more than it would the Reich and its institutions. Under these
threats the reluctant governments yielded; the Bundesrat voted unanimously

for dissolution.3' Nevertheless, Bismarck did not get everything he desired.
The minister of war blocked his demand that martial law be imposed on Berlin and that six regiments patrol the streets to "impress the mob"—so he told
Baroness Spitzemberg. Nor did ministers support his demand for one thousand
additional policemen and for imposition of controls (passports) to inhibit migration into the capital. Bismarck complained of their "cowardice," "irresolution," and "obstructionism." "Unless I stage a coup, I can't get anything
done."32
In his memoirs Bismarck reported what sinister thoughts invaded his mind
when the ministers voted against dissolution. They appeared so well informed
concerning the willingness of the national liberals to reverse themselves on
the antisocialist bill that it confirmed his suspicion that an agreement had
already been struck for the "division of my legacy." The successive moves of
his opponents were like "lightning flashes," each illuminating part of the
landscape, "allowing me to comprehend the entire situation." His enemies
were planning a "Gladstone cabinet," whose potential members were Stosch,
Eulenburg, Friedenthal, Camphausen, Rickert, and possibly even Windthorst. Whether such a cabinet, if assembled, would have been stable, was a
question the plotters never considered. "The chief purpose was negative—to
get rid of me—and on that subject the partners in this enterprise were united
for the time being. Each could hope, once that objective was achieved, to
force the others out. That is the way things go in all heterogeneous coalitions,
whose only bond is dislike of what exists. The entire combination had no
success at that time because neither the king nor the crown prince could be
won for it."33
The passage, written in the 1890s, was obviously intended to put Wilhelm
II in a poor light in comparison with his father and grandfather—loyalty to
himself being for Bismarck the criterion of political wisdom. But it was probably also an accurate recall of his thoughts in the summer of 1878. Once again
he was beset by a sense of isolation and a near paranoiac suspicion that dark
conspiracies were being hatched by a most improbable combination of polit31

he received in mid-August from Botho Eulenburg, who threatened to resign because Bismarck
had sent "an underling," Tiedemann, to reprove him for a mistake in procedure, namely, publishing the new antisocialist bill before the Bundesrat had acted on it. GW, XV, 374-376, 378.

ical foes. At the diplomatic dinner that ended the Congress of Berlin on
June 24, he regaled his guests with a discourse on Prussian history intended
to prove that "every sovereign" (sicl) since the Great Elector had been joy­
fully received at the start of his reign and hated at the end. "So it will be in
my case." He recounted the story of his political career and declared that he
was glad to be "unpopular again."35
Election of 1878
Earlier elections had shown German liberals the advantages of universal male
suffrage; that of 1878 revealed its dangers. National patriotism, which from
1867 to 1874 had reinforced their appeal to the electorate, now became a
weapon of the government and their conservative foes. Bismarck defined the
issues for voters in a manifesto published in the official Provinzkd'Konespcm.'
denz on June 27 under the title, "The purposes and wishes of the governments
concerning the election." Originally composed by a press secretary, this doc­
ument was twice painstakingly revised by the chancellor for maximum ef­
fect.36 The final version declared bluntly that the aim of "the governments"
was to gain a "reliable majority" in the Reichstag at the cost of the National
Liberal party. Because it could form majorities either with the right, middle,
or left of the chamber, that party had a "dominating position," which was
tolerable only as long as it gave heed to the wishes of "the governments."37
Since the beginning of 1878, however, the attitude of the national liberals
had changed. Instead of cooperating with the government, they demanded
the right to review and approve government bills before their introduction
into the chamber. No government could accept that kind of "tutelage" from
a party that did not possess a majority.
Then the manifesto zeroed in on a still smaller target. Within the National
Liberal party, it asserted, the left wing had established its "leadership," with
the consequence that the party regularly allied itself with the progressives. For
years this coalition had obstructed government efforts to check radical agita­
tion, culminating in the rejection of the antisocialist bill in May. It was "in­
disputable" that the Progressive party had prepared the way for socialism since

1862 by "systematically undermining all pillars of the monarchical state."
Along with ultramontane attacks upon the "authority of the state," it had set
the stage for the socialist assault upon law, order, and morality. People who
lived in this atmosphere and from this "nourishment" lost their sense of values
and respect even for a "venerated and beloved Kaiser." Not until the ruler
was wounded had the National Liberal party concluded, under the pressure of
public opinion, that legislation was necessary. Whether the governments
continued their relationship to the moderates in the party depended upon
whether the moderates severed their links with the progressives afidrthrew off
the "domination" of Lasker, Bamberger, and their associates, who were actually progressives masquerading as national liberals. Moderate national liberals
must clearly establish in the election campaign that they firmly supported the
governments not merely because of the exigencies of the moment but also for
the "lasting security of the state."
In order to prevent the "collapse of our monarchical and political order,"
Bismarck was determined to face a "series of difficult struggles." The Reichstag
would be dissolved repeatedly until the voters repudiated attempts by leftwing liberals to seize power. The deputies' incomprehension of the government's program for reducing direct taxes, a tobacco monopoly, and liquidation of state assessments was evidence of their impracticality. Jurists, officials,
and academicians were incapable of feeling or understanding the ills of industry and commerce. They were men of "philosophical, humanistic orientation" without "productive occupations," inexperienced in practical affairs,
and inclined toward rhetoric, doctrinairism, and party politics. They had
"neither an interest in nor an understanding of the economic needs of their
producing constituents."
Bismarck's election manifesto of June 1878, which hardly mentioned socialism, was an open declaration of war upon the left wing of the National
Liberal party. In effect, it called for their expulsion from the party, the subservience of the moderate majority to the government, and repudiation by
the voters of all democratic liberals. What Bismarck had been unable to accomplish with a lump of sugar (his offer to Bennigsen in 1877) he now proposed to achieve with a whip. He judged that five years of economic depression, anxieties over the spread of socialism, and general revulsion over the
deeds of Hodel and Nobiling had produced a mood in the country that would
enable him simultaneously to liquidate the liberal era, which had outlived its
usefulness and become a political liability; to break up the combination of
foes within parliament and government that he believed to be plotting his
downfall; and to provide a docile majority in the Reichstag that would enable
him to gain that secure grip on the entire apparatus of government for which
he still grappled. But the manifesto also served to convert the election of 1878
into a plebiscite. The voters were asked to choose between Bismarck, the
unifier of Germany and master of European diplomacy, and the "conspirators"
who wished to supplant him. The ministers, deputies, and courtiers, whose

* The Antisocialist Statute *

405

"obstructionism" and "procrastination" had tortured his nerves and injured
his health, were to be cowed by a convincing demonstration of his political
clout. Yet the master of Realpolitik did not rely on mere personal charisma to
achieve that end. On the contrary, he appealed to special interests—to hardpressed landowners and farmers, bankers, industrialists, merchants, and shopkeepers—by indicating his wish to jettison liberal economics in favor of the
interventionist state.
Bismarck's manifesto set the tone for the election campaign. Following his
lead, the conservative and official press loosed a torrent of abuse against Bennigsen, Stauffenberg, Lasker, and other leaders. "Socialism is. . . one of the
worst and yet just one of many horrors spawned by liberalism" was a typical
accusation by the Kreuzzeitung. Centrist newspapers rejoiced that their moment of revenge against liberal persecutors had finally arrived, charging that
the liberal attack on the church had weakened resistance to subversive doctrines.38 Indeed the liberals had fallen into an evil situation. For six years they
had voted with enthusiasm for exceptional laws against Catholics, the
Reichstag's expulsion of the Jesuit order in 1872 being the most notable example. In voting against the lex Hodel, however, they went on record for the
civil rights of socialists and other subversives.39 In defending the liberal position before the Reichstag on May 23, Bennigsen sought to reconcile this
contradiction by arguing lamely that the anti-Jesuit law had affected only
hundreds, while the lex Hodel would affect hundreds of thousands.40 After
Nobiling's shots the contradiction could no longer be maintained, and the
national liberals were eager to reverse themselves. By dissolving the chamber,
Bismarck deprived them of the opportunity. Their political gyrations made
the national liberals vulnerable to charges from the right of being "soft on
radicalism" and from the left of being inconsistent and unprincipled.
By interpreting the election to voters as a struggle between the government
and the liberals, Bismarck's manifesto aggravated the liberals' predicament. If
moderates in the National Liberal party accepted the oppositional role thrust
upon them by the chancellor and right-wing press, they would lend credence
to Bismarck's charge that they had abdicated party leadership to the Lasker
group. By repudiating that role, on the other hand, they would expose themselves to the charge of again capitulating to Bismarck and of sacrificing the
remaining shreds of their liberalism. Both choices threatened the unity of the
party. For moderates the first course was distasteful, for Lasker and his associates the latter.
Yet the need to preserve party unity triumphed for the time being over

"THE BILL IS AIMED AT THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS, BUT WHAT IF IT SHOULD FLY OVER ITS TARGET?"

Bismarck's effort to drive in the fatal wedge. Under Bennigsen's urging the
party press moderated the polemical tone in which it replied to the provocations of the government and the right-wing press. Appalled by the consequences of his brief flirtation with the idea of constitutional reform, the Hanoverian strove to reassert his leadership over the party without alienating the
left wing. In the interest of unity Lasker, under pressure from Stauffenberg
and Stephani, permitted the election platform he had composed for the party
to be defused of its "oppositional tendency." The national liberals, Stephani
wrote to Bennigsen, must avoid giving the impression that the election contest was personal: Lasker contra Bismarck. Otherwise the result would be a
fiasco, for on such an issue "we do not have the nation behind us." Bismarck's
success in the Congress of Berlin had "mightily" increased his "authority and
popularity." To attack him personally would make the national liberals the
laughingstock of the country. The defeat would be so catastrophic that the
"moderate middle parties" would lose their position of leadership for an indefinite time. "Unknown figures will replace each other in continuing fluctuation and change." Once they surmounted their initial panic and confusion, the national liberals fought the election against the socialists rather than
against Bismarck, as a contest between parties supporting the state (staatserhaltende) and those inimical to it (staatsfeindliche).*1
On July 30, 1878, the voters dealt the liberal parties another severe, although not a catastrophic defeat. In three elections (1874, 1877, and 1878)

407

the national liberals had declined from 155 to 128 to 99 seats, the progressives
from 49 to 35 to 26. By contrast the conservatives had risen from 22 to 40 to
59, the free conservatives from 33 to 38 to 57, the centrists from 91 to 93 to
94. Distressing to Bismarck and liberals alike was the surprising success of the
Guelph party, which grew from 4 to 10 seats, conquering more than half of
the nineteen constituencies in the province of Hanover. Naturally the fortunes of the social democrats were scrutinized closely. Under the circumstances the decline in their voting strength was small (from 493,288 in 1877
to 437,158 voters in 1878). The decline in constituencies captured was proportionately greater (12 to 9); again cooperation among "bourgeois parties"
in runoff elections robbed the social democrats of a representation (2.3 percent of the chamber) commensurate with their voting strength (7.6 percent
of the electorate).42
Of equal interest was the fate of the left wing of the National Liberal party.
Following Bismarck's lead, Lasker was made the general whipping boy of the
conservative and official press. Carl Braun described the scene: "Whenever
anything goes wrong somewhere, whenever someone loses money on a speculation, whenever business is bad, whenever someone has corns or suffers
from a badly made shoe, he is told, 'Lasker is the cause of it. He made those
bad laws under which you suffer.' "43 In the attempt to unseat Lasker the free
conservatives chose as their opposing candidate none other than Herbert von
Bismarck, who ran with his father's blessing. The constituency, however, was
in the duchy of Sachsen-Meiningen, outside the direct reach of the Prussian
bureaucracy. Lasker won by a wide margin.44 Stauffenberg too was singled out
as a special target with the consequence that he lost in his old constituency
at Munich; in the runoff election Bennigsen found for him a safe district in

Bismarck vented his displeasure to the Duke of Sachsen-Meiningen, maintaining that the
local Landrat had supported Lasker, with whom he was befriended. GW, VIc, 117-119. In the
runoff election Herbert sought a seat at Ratzeburg in Lauenburg, where Friedrichsruh is located.

election. With Lucius's help, Tiedemann found him a seat at Langensalza in the runoff election,

Braunschweig. The other major figures of the left wing—Forckenbeck, Bamberger, Rickert—also survived the onslaught. Yet the left wing suffered proportionately greater losses than the right. Within the National Liberal party
occurred in 1878 the same shift to the right that was evident in the electorate
as a whole.45
Although its losses were not as great as some expected, the National Liberal
party experienced in 1878 a severe psychological blow. For the first time since
1866 Prussia's moderate liberals had felt the full fury of Bismarck's assault and
witnessed its effect on the voters. To non-Prussians among them the experience was totally new. Bred and educated in the idealist tradition, many did
not relish the experience of being at odds with the "state," symbolized by
Bismarck, the Kaiser, and the ruling order. Some were troubled by genuine
doubt that the Rechtsstaat could protect society against radical subversion.
Bismarck stated his price—by purging the party of Lasker and associates, the
national liberals could return to that comfortable and fruitful relationship
with the government that they had enjoyed for a decade. To many the price
had begun to look worth paying.46
The Lex Nobiling
After returning to Berlin on June 3, 1878, Bismarck, who had barely recovered from his recent bouts with shingles and rheumatism, had to endure for
four weeks the wear and tear of a European congress. At the outset the man
upon whose skill, more than that of any other person, the peace of Europe
depended, thought that his condition would not permit him to attend more
than two or three sessions. Official business of any sort, he complained,
robbed him of sleep.47 Afterward, somewhat fortified psychologically by the
success of the congress, he spent one month at Bad Kissingen followed by
another at Bad Gastein. At the Bavarian spa he exchanged visits with the
British Marquess of Lome, who recorded his impressions. "He has grown
stouter but still holds himself as erect as ever. He was very breathless after
coming up the stairs, his eyes watered a great deal, and his look of a gallant
great mastiff filling up the sofa was more marked than of old." Although Bismarck's eyes were blue, the impression they left on Lome was "yellow
brown."48
The prince was satisfied with the results of his Kissingen cure; to one of his
visitors there he looked "physically strengthened." But FaIk, who saw him
later at Gastein, found him "uncommonly nervous and excited," full of com45

plaints about the long-standing "conspiracy" (for which he cited dates and
details) of the national liberals against him, about his earlier breach with the
conservatives that had left him "a lonely man in old age," and about the
"ingratitude of the world" that most statesmen experience. "I am tired and
embittered; it would be for the best if the bullet of an assassin should kill
me."+»
Returning to Berlin on September 16, Bismarck plunged into the Reichstag
debate on the new antisocialist bill and promptly fell ill. The medical diagnosis was urticaria, a skin inflammation arising either from infection or diet.50
But Bismarck preferred another explanation: "The shorthand stenographers
[of the Reichstag] turned against me in connection with my last speech [September 17]. As long as I was popular that was not the case. They garbled what
I said so that there was no sense in it. When murmurs were heard from the
Left or Center, they omitted the word 'Left,' and, when there was applause,
they forgot to mention it. The whole bureau acts in the same way. But I have
complained to the president. It was that which made me ill. It was like the
illness produced by oversmoking, a stuffiness in the head, giddiness, a disposition to vomit, etc." 5 ' Although he was out of bed again after two days, the
resumption of business soon wore him out. Despite a week at Varzin (September 23-29) and nearly two weeks at Friedrichsruh (October 22-November 3),
he felt compelled to request another extended leave. "My health leaves much
to be desired," he wrote to Wilhelm on November 9. "I need absolute quiet
for a while; I haven't had that for a long time."52 Since May 14, 1875, the
German chancellor had spent 772 out of 1,275 days either at a spa or on one
of his estates. To be sure, he was not always idle during those long absences.
But the business of government surely suffered, and his critics were certainly
justified in questioning, as did he, whether he was any longer able to govern.
As Bismarck anticipated, the election of 1878 ended conclusively the possibility that the two liberal parties could dominate the Reichstag. The parliament was now divided into three major groups of approximately equal
strength: liberals, conservatives, centrists. Hence Bismarck appeared to have
a choice between two majorities: the conservative parties could be combined
with either the Center party or National Liberal party.53 The former course
required the liquidation or, at best, moderation of the Kulturkampf.
To the master of Realpolitik it had long been evident that the assault on the
Center party and the Catholic church could not be conducted simultaneously

with the opening of new fronts against socialists and left-liberals. Hence it
was hardly coincidental that the first positive signs of a willingness to settle
the Kulturkampf appeared in late 1875 when he first formulated his new objectives in domestic affairs at Varzin.54 Yet his determination not to "go to
Canossa" was genuine; what he wanted was reconciliation without surrender.
The news that Pius IX was dead, telegraphed to Varzin on February 8, 1878,
put Bismarck in a good mood. "We must drink to that," he exclaimed, ordering a bottle of Nordhauser.55 A second telegram that arrived in Berlin on
February 20 announced the election (as Pope Leo XIII) of Cardinal Pecci,
who was rumored to be conciliatory. But Bismarck was skeptical: "When lions
change into lambs, the waves will flow backwards."56 In March Leo announced his succession to Wilhelm in a friendly message, to which the Kaiser
replied in kind. By mid-April there was considerable optimism in the German
diplomatic corps and among high church officials over the prospect of a settlement, but Bismarck was less sanguine. A second message from the Vatican
dated April 17 seemed to confirm his suspicion that the pope's price for peace
was too high; namely, repeal of the May laws and restoration of articles 15,
16, and 18 in the Prussian constitution. Yet Leo sent out so many peace feelers
in May and June that it became impossible to doubt his desire to treat.57
While at Bad Kissingen Bismarck conferred repeatedly with the papal nuncio, Cardinal Aloisi Masella (July 30-August 16). Although the discussions
were cordial, both men realized that their positions were irreconcilable. The
Nuncios spoke for the restoration of the relationship between church and
state existing before 1870, the chancellor for that existing before 1840. Instead of seeking a general settlement, they discussed a truce, Bismarck offering
to go "a little way toward Canossa," by moderating execution of the May laws,
if the Vatican would exert a favorable influence on the centrists, Poles, and
ultramontane press.58 Actually the prince believed that even this modus Vivendi could only be achieved "very gradually, a drop at a time." For the time
being, the Vatican must be given the impression that Berlin was happy with
the status quo and had no need to change it.59
His experiences in the Kulturkampf had made Bismarck less optimistic than
51 See his remarks to Heinnch von Sybel and Edwin von Manteuffel as quoted in Erich

rapprochement began gingerly on both sides. Bismarck refused to receive the pope's first message
to the Kaiser, because it came through the wrong channel—the papal nuncio at Munich, not the
Bavarian government. The pope on the other hand, took umbrage at the delay m the Kaiser's
reply and at its language—German.

he had been in 1871 about the authority of the pope over Catholics in other
than religious matters. "The Center party is a force that he can use to attack
us but not to support us, even if he should honestly and lastingly intend to do
so." If the Center party should dissolve, he reasoned, most of its fragments
would reemerge as Guelphs, south German particularists, progressives, proAustrian great-Germanists, pro-French Alsatians, and other malcontented
groups. Their hostility toward Prussia and the German Reich had other

grounds than merely their Catholicism. "The pope," he told FaIk in late August, "does not have the least influence on the Center party." Hence the
Kulturkampf would have to continue for a time. Perhaps in ten to fifteen years
the German schools would create by their work of "national education" a
better basis for ending it. For the time being, however, it would be unwise to
let the public know that there was no prospect of a settlement. "In my opinion
the uncertainty must be maintained as long as possible. The belief in an approaching reconciliation between state and curia will unquestionably be beneficial for the conduct of the curia, the Center, and the liberal parties."60
That Bismarck had met with Masella in Kissingen was reported in the German press, and the Kreuzzeitung jumped to the conclusion that the chancellor
had conclusively broken with the National Liberal party.61 But this was not
at all the case; the Kissingen talks with Masella had merely confirmed that
the chancellor was still dependent, at least for the time being, upon the national liberals for his legislative program. In mid-August he found an opportunity to present his terms to Bennigsen and colleagues through Robert von
Benda, a right-wing liberal deputy who happened to be in Kissingen. Violating his own instructions to FaIk (did he expect Bennigsen not to believe
him?), he admitted to Benda that the centrists were "unusable" and that the
talks with Masella, although "very serious" in intent, could produce nothing
more than a modus vivendi. Yet he expressed satisfaction over the results of
the election. "Now we have learned that the country thinks much differently
than did the old Reichstag." What he hoped for, he said, was a firmer cohesion between the "three parties friendly to the government" and the expulsion
from the National Liberal party of about two dozen deputies who really belonged among the progressives. "Always the same old song," commented
Benda. The deputy objected that the loss of so many members would jeopardize the majority, but the chancellor insisted on the accuracy of his calculation. Finally, Bismarck reiterated three times another "old song." "On the
whole . . . the party caucuses, whether conservative or liberal, are for him
completely indifferent, today more than ever. He will go his own way. Those
who go with him are his friends; those who oppose him are enemies—to the
last breath." If the goal was not attained now, there could be a second and
even third dissolution. "I do not want it, but it could come to that."62
What Bismarck wanted of the National Liberal party was what he demanded of his colleagues in the Prussian government: unconditional subordination. The language he used and attitudes he displayed are reminiscent of
his arguments for the reorientation of Prussian foreign policy during the decade before he came to power in 1862—indifference to political idealism,

resolute pursuit of self-interest, and ruthless use of the tactic of alternative
choice. Yet his range of options had been seriously narrowed by the folly of
the Kulturkampf. The prejudices and near paranoid fears that had led him
into the attack on the Catholic church had caused him to violate his own
philosophy of political realism. In the 1850s he had contended that Prussia
could not afford to leave covered any squares on the chessboard of European
politics. But the Kulturkampf had removed nearly one-third of the Reichstag
from the field of play. For all his talk of "complete indifference" about allies,
Bismarck was still dependent upon national liberals for the execution of his
policies. Hence he had to hammer away at the party's contours in order to
reshape it to fit his needs.
When the Reichstag convened on September 9, 1878, the national liberals, chastened by recent experiences, were ready to vote for an antisocialist
bill.63 The only issue was to what degree they would follow Lasker and his
left-wing allies in seeking to limit the bill's infringement of civil rights. Even
Lasker favored strengthening the criminal code against subversives; yet he was
as opposed on principle to an "exceptional law" against socialists as he had
been against the Jesuit law of 1872. Although hostility toward him was growing within the party, Lasker was too important not to be included among the
seven national liberals chosen for the ad hoc committee of twenty-one members, chaired by Bennigsen, that was established to consider the government's
bill. During its sessions in late September he introduced a number of amendments intended to mitigate the bill's more draconian features. This earned
him a sharp attack in the Nordtkutsche Attgemeine Zeitung (obviously stemming from Bismarck), which shook the deputies by threatening another dissolution. Hurrying back and forth between the chancellor and national liberal
caucus, Bennigsen produced another of those familiar "compromises" that
had marked the course of the moderates since 1866—it gave the chancellor
most, although not all, of what he wanted. In the crucial party caucus on
October 9, Lasker complained bitterly that Bennigsen had left him uninformed and unconsulted. But the Hanoverian had so outmaneuvered Lasker
that only two other deputies (Stauffenberg and Bamberger) came to his support.64
The antisocialist law of October 21, 1878, outlawed "social-democratic,
socialistic, and communistic" organizations that aimed to overthrow the ex63
Needing their support, Bismarck avoided conflict by advising conservatives to vote for the
reelection of Forckenbeck as president. More suprising was the reelection of Stauffenberg as first
vice-president, but this was owing to the tactical situation in the voting. The first ballot showed
a three-way division between Stauffenberg, a conservative, and a centrist. The conservative candidate withdrew, and Stauffenberg received the liberal and free conservative votes, the latter in
return for the reelection of Hohenlohe-Langenburg as second vice-president. The conservatives
either withheld their votes or voted for the centrist—an ominous development. Oncken, Bennigsen, II, 390.

isting political and social order or whose activities endangered the public
peace, "especially harmony between the social classes." Publications could be
forbidden and assemblies dissolved in which such tendencies became evident.
Officers of, and even landlords providing quarters for, prohibited organizations could be imprisoned up to one year, organization members up to three
months plus a fine of 500 marks. Convicted agitators could be refused sojourn
in "designated districts and places" and denied residence where they had lived
for less than six months. Offending proprietors of inns, taverns, liquor stores,
publishing houses, bookstores, lending libraries, and reading rooms could be
fined, imprisoned, and put out of business. With Bundesrat approval "limited
martial law" could be declared in "endangered" districts, permitting police to
prohibit public meetings, halt the distribution of printed matter, and deport
agitators. Lasker's only achievement was a clause limiting duration of the statute to March 31, 1881—a concession extracted from Bismarck by Bennigsen
in the interest of preserving party unity. In the final vote on October 19, the
national liberals—Lasker included, albeit reluctantly—joined with conservatives and free conservatives to outvote, 221 to 149, an opposition composed of centrists, progressives, and social democrats.65
Although too much for Lasker, the antisocialist law did not go far enough
for Bismarck. He was sharply critical of the way Botho Eulenburg managed
the bill in the Bundesrat and of certain features incorporated in it even before
it reached the Reichstag. He would have preferred, for example, a clause providing for the dismissal, without pension rights, of government officials who
were socialists. "The majority of the poorly paid subaltern officials in Berlin
and, in addition, the railway signalmen, switchmen, and workers in similar
categories are socialists, a fact of obvious danger in the event of uprisings and
troop movements. If the law is to be effective, I do not believe it possible to
let citizens, legally proven to be socialists, retain the right to vote, the right
to stand for election, and the pleasure and privilege of sitting in the Reichstag."66 In the Reichstag during October 1878, Bismarck continued publicly to
express confidence in the efficacy of universal male suffrage,67 but privately
he had already begun to speculate on its abolition. "I consider the [antisocialist] statute just a first step," he told Lucius, "which must be followed by
others."68

Balkan Crisis and Congress of Berlin

URING his extended leave at Varzin in the summer and fall of 1875,
Bismarck had the chance not only to rethink his internal policy but
also to absorb the lessons of the war-in-sight crisis. The attempt to
isolate and bully France into abandoning the rebuilding of its army
had failed, as had the effort to garner support abroad for the Prussian Kulturkampf. The only consequence of these actions had been to give the French
and Russian foreign ministers the opportunity to demonstrate to Bismarck
that an aggressive, threatening foreign policy could only end in Germany's
isolation and that the great powers of Europe would close ranks to prevent
any additional disruption of the balance of power system. Although the German chancellor remained irritated by the diplomatic defeat he had suffered in
May 1875 and the manner of its infliction, he realistically concluded that his
tactics, although not his grand strategy, had to change.
His basic objective remained the same, that of isolating France, assuring
Germany of at least two allies in an unstable equilibrium of five and finding
those allies preferably in Russia and Austria. He remained as convinced as
ever that the French were a volatile and vengeful people, whose friendship
could not be won. Much depended, however, on who governed France and
under what form of government. A republic, particularly one established by
the narrowest of margins, was of no advantage to Germany unless governed
by republicans. As long as the monarchial and clerical faction under MacMahon held power, he considered France an active danger to Germany.' Yet
the new policy Bismarck adopted toward France after 1875, that of distraction
and diversion, had the virtue that it could be pursued toward a conservative
as well as a radical republican government. The greatest danger to Bismarck's
grand strategy in 1875-1880 came, however, not from a resurgent France but
from the prospect that Russia would become involved in a war against Austria
or England or both.

Emergence of the Eastern Crisis
The embroilment that produced this threat was again the "eastern question,"
the most persistent source of international friction in Europe from 1815 to
1914. After twenty years of relative quiescence, the problem again became

acute owing to a series of rebellions and wars by Balkan peoples against the
Ottoman Empire that began in July 1875 with an uprising in the provinces of
2
Bosnia and Herzegovina. The rebels had mixed motives: religion (Christian
versus Moslem), nationalism (southern Slavs against Turks), government
(corruption, inequitable taxation, an incompetent judiciary), and economics
(poor peasants against Moslem landlords). Without outside help and encour­
agement the insurgency would scarcely have become important. But German
and Italian unification had aroused nationalistic aspirations everywhere. Ser­
bia aspired to unite the southern Slavs into a single state; for two decades
Slavic nationalists in Russia had fostered a Panslav movement calling for the
union of all European Slavs under Russian leadership, an objective that could
only be achieved through dissolution of the Habsburg and Ottoman empires.
Within the Habsburg monarchy some groups were eager to annex Bosnia and
Herzegovina—military men, who desired a more defensible frontier behind
Austria's exposed Dalmatian coast, and Croats, who longed for a southern
Slav union that would lead to the conversion of the Dual into a Triple Mon­
archy. Like fellow Magyars, Andrassy was opposed to the incorporation of
more Slavs in the Habsburg Empire. The Ottoman Empire, he believed, was
a necessary barrier to the advance of national movements in the Balkans,
movements that, if successful, would "ruin" the Dual Monarchy and make it
the "sick man" of Europe.3 The monarchy's German liberals also believed that
the Ottoman Empire had to be preserved if Austrian business interests were
to succeed in developing the lower Danube and controlling the railway route
to Saloniki. The empire's disintegration, furthermore, would open opportu­
nities for Russian economic and political penetration into the Balkans. With
strong support from Germans and Magyars, neither of whom wished to in­
clude more Slavs in the Habsburg Empire, Andrassy sought to dampen the
revolt by securing concessions from Constantinople for the rebels. On his
initiative the European powers instructed their consuls in August 1875 to try
to settle the dispute, and, when this failed, Andrassy gained the support of
the powers for a reform program to be forced upon the government in Con­
stantinople. But the reforms demanded in the "Andrassy note" (December
30, 1875) came to naught, for they were too much for the Porte and too little

for the insurgents. During the spring of 1876 the Turkish army made little
progress against the rebels, and the rebellion began to spread.4
The conflicting counsels and interests that characterized the Habsburg Empire were evident also in Russia and Britain. Since the Crimean disaster Russia had satisfied its imperialistic hunger in the east, expanding its borders on
the weaker Asiatic front and remaining on the defensive in the west. Tsar
Alexander II and his closest advisers believed that this policy must be continued until Russia had completed the internal consolidation that began with
the social and political reforms of the 1860s. Without that consolidation Russia was not powerful enough, fiscally and militarily, to contest with the great
powers of central and western Europe for control over the Balkans. And yet
Panslav agitation, which penetrated the most diverse groups within the middle and upper strata of Russian society, subjected the government to pressures
it could not ignore. Although Alexander made the chief decisions in foreign
policy, he was dependent for counsel and execution upon Chancellor Gorchakov, who, now in his late seventies, was disinclined to be adventurous.
Gorchakov was subject to contradictory pressures and persuasions by his subordinates, including two whom he suspected of wanting to succeed him:
Count Peter Shuvalov, ambassador to Britain, and General Nikolay Ignatyev,
ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. The former was a conservative supporter
of Russia's partnership in the Three Emperors League; the latter, a dedicated
Panslav.5
The developing crisis in the Near East became a testing ground for Disraeli's resolve, on taking office in February 1874, that Britain must play a more
active role in continental affairs. Since completion of the Suez Canal in 1869,
the eastern Mediterranean had become the most sensitive region in British
foreign policy. That Suez was the "key to India" had become the undisputed
dogma of British strategic thinking. In November 1875 the Egyptian Knedive
put his share (46 percent) of the Suez Canal Company up for sale, and, while
French financiers haggled, Disraeli acted. Although the controlling interest
in the company remained with Ferdinand de Lesseps's company, the prime
minister exulted that France was no longer in a position to shut up the canal
in any future crisis, severing Britain's shortest route to India. By the same
token, he was convinced that Britain must seek to preserve the Ottoman
Empire, especially Constantinople and the Straits, from Russian penetration.
The empire must stand as a buffer protecting the eastern Mediterranean from

Russian expansion. And yet Disraeli's unfortunate choice as foreign secretary,
Lord Derby, was a mistrustful and withdrawn man, who tended to oppose any
decisive action that might result in war.6
Initially Bismarck welcomed the Balkan uprising, for it diverted attention
of governments and the public away from the "French-German question" and
the drubbing he had recently suffered in the war-in-sight crisis.7 His basic
premise was that Germany had no direct interest in the Balkans; the problems
of the Ottoman Empire were of importance to Germany only for their effect
upon the relationships between the other great powers. If Austria and Russia
came to blows over the issue, Germany might have to choose between them,
and the rejected suitor would very likely seek support in France. Again and
again he insisted that Germany would agree to no proposition by Austria or
Russia regarding the Balkans until those powers had reached an agreement
with each other. War between Britain and Russia over the Turkish legacy was
less dangerous for Germany than one between Austria and Russia, but only
relatively so, for Austria might be tempted, as in the Crimean War, to enter
the conflict.8 To avoid such a chain reaction, Bismarck naturally supported
Andrassy's peace initiatives in the Ottoman Empire. Since Alexander and
Gorchakov also cooperated, the Three Emperors League appeared to have
found a new common purpose. In fact, all of the signatory powers of the Paris
treaty of 1856 (including France, Italy, and, albeit reluctantly, Britain) supported the Andrassy note. Superficially, the old concert of Europe had been
reborn. And yet there was general skepticism that the decline and dissolution
of the Ottoman Empire could be halted. Now the question was what should
take its place.9
In late November 1875 Bismarck returned to Berlin with a partial answer
to this question that would have enabled Berlin to recover the central role in
the European balance of power so laboriously established during 1864—1873.
His objective was obviously that which he later described in the "Kissingen
dictation": "a total political situation, in which all powers, except France,
need us and are kept from coalitions against us as much as possible by their
relations to each other."10 His first step was an attempted rapprochement with
Britain. In November he warmly approved London's purchase of Suez Canal
Company shares, and on January 2, 1876, he told Ambassador Odo Russell
of his desire for a "frank and cordial understanding" with the Disraeli cabinet

on the Balkan problem. Germany, he explained, could neither afford to let
Austria and Russia "become too intimate behind her back" nor "let them
quarrel with safety to herself." Peace depended, he declared, upon the cooperation of those powers, but there was danger that Andrassy might be swept
aside by annexationists in Vienna eager to intervene in the Balkans. Three
days later he suggested to Russian Ambassador Paul d'Oubril that the best way
to buttress Andrassy's position would be to arrange an "arrondissement" for
Austria in Bosnia in exchange for "advantages" for Russia in Bessarabia. He
believed that Britain would accept "similar bagatelles" in order to fulfill her
objectives at Suez. "I ask for just one thing—to be charged with preparing the
English cabinet and getting its agreement for this combination."11 On February 19 Bismarck advised the British that war could be avoided in the Balkan
crisis only in two ways: cordial cooperation among the powers to maintain the
territorial status quo and, if that were unsuccessful, an amicable settlement
among the powers concerning "what should be done with Turkey." Being
"territorially saturated," Germany had no interest in the matter other than to
preserve the peace in Europe. But the British response to these overtures was
cool and dilatory, and Gorchakov declined to concede to Bismarck such a
brilliant role. The Russian chancellor wrote to Oubril that Bismarck, like
Napoleon III in his time, reminded him of "!e grand tentateur sur h mantagne."12

The failure of the Andrassy note, followed by the spread of the Balkan
rebellion to Bulgaria and the murder of the German and French consuls at
Saloniki, gave new urgency to the Balkan crisis in April-May 1876. On May
n - 1 4 the foreign ministers of the Three Emperors League met in Berlin to
consider what further steps should be taken against Turkey. Moved by rising
Panslav agitation, Gorchakov arrived with a proposal for a European conference to force Turkey to accept reforms in the insurgent region—to be supervised by an international commission backed by a military occupation. In a
private conference before the tripartite meeting Bismarck repeated to Andrassy his proposal for a mutual rectification of frontiers, for Austria in Bosnia
and Russia in Bessarabia. But Andrassy rejected such drastic steps, and the
three powers accepted his program (the "Berlin memorandum"), calling for a
European initiative to effect a two months' armistice for the execution of
reforms and a naval demonstration at Constantinople by the six signatory
powers of the 1856 Treaty of Paris.
On May 13, Gorchakov, as the eldest of the three chancellors, presented
their joint proposal to the ambassadors of the other three nations—Britain,

France, and Italy—in his polished, oratorical French (Bismarck doodled:
"Pompon, pompo, pomp, po!"). He would like an affirmative answer, Gorchakov declared, before his and Andrassy's departure from Berlin on May 15.
Although France and Italy complied, Disraeli and his colleagues were offended by the subordinate role London was expected to play in the affair and
by the peremptory treatment (May 13-15 was a weekend, hardly a time to get
action out of a British cabinet). They refused to "put a knife to Turkey's
throat," a country whose survival was still an axiom of British policy. Gorchakov returned to Russia outraged by the British attitude, a mood that influenced his conduct in the following months. Bismarck, however, "fell into a
fit of laughing" over the Russian chancellor's discomfiture.,3
An Untimely Question
As so often in the past, events in the Balkans had a way of forcing the powers
to engage in actions contrary to their original intentions. The seeming paralysis of the sultan's government encouraged other Balkan peoples to join the
attack. In the late spring of 1876 the Bulgarians rebelled, and at the end of
June Serbia and Montenegro were emboldened to declare war against Turkey
with the aim of uniting the southern Slavs under a single crown. The future
of the Ottoman Empire was no longer a hypothetical problem. The European
powers were now compelled to cope with what they apparently could no
longer avoid. In contemplating the possibilities of the Balkan situation, the
powers were beset by fear tempered by avarice. The task of preserving peace
among the great powers, still Bismarck's primary objective, became more difficult. In October, he summarized the problem: "The question whether we are
to be brought into permanent friction with England, even more with Austria,
and most of all with Russia over the Eastern tangle is infinitely more important for Germany's future than all the relations of Turkey to her subjects and
to the European powers."14
The Serbian-Montenegrin attack on Turkey brought Panslav agitation in
Russia to a new peak. Russian volunteers and contributions of goods and
money began to flow toward Belgrade. Officially Alexander and Gorchakov
held to a policy of nonintervention despite mounting public pressure. But
secretly they approached Austria in search of an agreement for the protection
of their respective interests whoever the victor, Turk or Slav. Andrassy now
accepted the likelihood that his policy of promoting Turkish reform had failed
and that Austria must assure for itself a proper share of Bosnia-Herzegovina
in view of the expected victory of the Serbs. On July 8, 1876, Franz Joseph

and Alexander met at Reichstadt in Bohemia, where their foreign ministers
worked out a secret agreement—or thought they did (there was no common
text)—on how to protect Balkan peoples if the Turks won and how to divide
Balkan soil if the Slavs triumphed. Subsequently the participants disputed
what each had obtained or yielded at Reichstadt. What had seemed so obvious in July that it need not be written down became obfuscated within weeks
by the unexpected victory of the Turks and the enlarged objectives of the
contracting parties. 's
Their eagerness to come to terms at Reichstadt had been stimulated by the
failure of both to reach agreement with Britain. Following its rejection of the
Berlin memorandum in May 1876, the British government ordered a naval
unit to Besika Bay at the mouth of the Dardanelles. But otherwise the London
cabinet temporized, Derby out of timidity and indecision, Disraeli because he
was too old and decrepit to take over the Foreign Office, with whose performance he was increasingly dissatisfied. But as the summer progressed the shifting current of British public opinion made it increasingly difficult for the British government to continue the traditional policy of supporting the integrity
of the Ottoman Empire.
In October 1875 the Balkan rebellions had upset the precarious balance of
the Turkish treasury, compelling the Porte to default on huge loans obtained
over decades from British and French banks at high rates of interest. While
this pained the financiers, the public was inflamed by rumors of the severity
with which Turkish irregular troops quickly put down the Bulgarian uprising.
In June, July, and August 1876 newspapers carried lurid accounts of Turkish
atrocities against the Bulgars and in July Disraeli and Derby answered parliamentary interpellations by claiming the reports were exaggerated. On September 6, 1876, Gladstone's famous pamphlet on The Bulgarian Horrors and
the Question of the East was published, of which forty thousand copies were
quickly sold. Violence and brutality had occurred on both sides in the Ottoman embroglio, but the British public had ears only for the sins of the Turks.
As popular hostility toward the Turks rose, the British government, like its
counterparts in Petersburg and Vienna, began to consider what Britain must
gain from the seemingly inevitable partition of the Ottoman Empire.l6
In July and August 1876 the Turkish army scored a series of victories over
the Serbs. The defeat of the Serbs, despite the help of Russian volunteers
(including a Russian general, who assumed command), increased the pressure

not in behalf of the Serbs, whose performance had been disappointing, then
of the Bulgars, whose fate had aroused the sympathies of all Europe. Popular
revulsion in Britain against Turkish atrocities raised doubts in Petersburg that
England would stand in the way, particularly if Russia's actions were proclaimed as necessary to save Christian peoples from Moslem barbarism.'7 In
bucolic Varzin Bismarck followed this development with detachment. He believed that a Russian war on Turkey was not only an inevitable but also a
desirable outcome of the crisis—as long as Russia acted in harmony with Austria in planning its objectives in the struggle. On September 13, he learned
from Andrassy for the first time the extent of the Reichstadt "agreement"—
as the Austrians understood it.' 8 The powers appeared to be adopting the
solution Bismarck had repeatedly urged: mutual compensation through partial
dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire.
And yet Bismarck was uneasy that autumn about German relations with
Russia. In late August he began to fear that frequent charges in the Russian
press that Germany was "cool" toward Panslav aspirations, in conjunction
with other "unfriendly" (Gorchakov) influences at the Russian court, might
adversely affect the tsar's attitude. He was compelled, furthermore, to risk
offending Gorchakov by declining the chancellor's proposal that Germany
call for a European conference to deal with the Balkan problem, lest German
foreign policy be engaged in behalf of purely Russian objectives. Another
source of uneasiness was a hiatus in German representation at the Russian
court. Ambassador Lothar von Schweinitz was on leave, hunting in the Austrian Alps, and Bismarck had no confidence in Oubril, a Roman Catholic,
whom he suspected of papism and intrigue. Hence Bismarck advised Wilhelm
to send Field Marshal Edwin von Manteuffel to the tsar, then attending military maneuvers at Warsaw. Manteuffel bore a personal letter from the Kaiser
(dated September 2) in which Wilhelm assured his nephew, "The memory of
your attitude toward me and my country from 1864 to 1870-1871 will guide
my policy toward Russia, whatever comes."19 On September 8, Manteuffel
returned from Warsaw, reporting that, although Alexander and Gorchakov
were nettled by Bismarck's refusal to comply with their conference proposal,
the tsar was clearly touched by Wilhelm's assurances of benevolent neutrality
if war proved necessary against the Turks. "I like to count on you," he wrote
to Wilhelm, "as you will always be able to count on me" (Bismarck: "The
only question is how far?").2°

Manteuffel also conveyed Alexander's wish for a "declaration in some form
or other to the effect that Russia has the sympathies of Germany in the eastern
question." Bismarck was leery of any such declaration, which in any event
could only reiterate what Wilhelm had already written. But on September 14
Oubril came to State Secretary Bernhard von Biilow, Bismarck's right arm in
the foreign office at Berlin, and reported that Alexander wanted answers to
two questions he claimed to have asked Manteuffel in Warsaw: What would
Germany's attitude be, if Russia's "dignity" required her to act independently?
What diplomatic action Bismarck would propose, since he was disinclined to
accept the Russian proposal for a six-power conference?21 Bismarck found that
such questions, delivered orally and almost casually, were contrary to diplomatic form. Gorchakov, he reasoned, could not have commissioned Oubril
to ask them, unless he had some ulterior purpose. In any case, the first question had already been answered in Wilhelm's letter of September 2, and the
second Bismarck branded an "impertinence." He ordered that no full answer
be given to Oubril, whom he believed deceitful.22
Two weeks later, however, it became evident that the tsar, now at Livadia
in the Crimea, was getting impatient. On October 1, General von Werder,
the German military attache, telegraphed from Livadia that Alexander urgently wanted a response to another question he claimed (Bismarck: "not
true!") to have asked Manteuffel at Warsaw: "Would Germany act as Russia
did in 1870, if Russia went to war with Austria?"23 In this most peculiar and
irregular way Bismarck was suddenly confronted with the critical question he
had hoped to avoid. He was being asked bluntly to choose between Germany's
two allies in the Three Emperors League.
Bismarck had no way of knowing how Alexander had progressed within
three weeks from concern about Germany's attitude toward Russia in the
event of war against Turkey to concern about how Germany would act should
Russia go to war against Austria. At Livadia the tsar was surrounded by generals, Panslavists, and imperialists eager for action in the Balkans. On September 21, he signed an order for partial mobilization in Russia's southwestern
military districts. Simultaneously he dispatched to Vienna a special emissary,
Count Felix Sumarokov-Elston, to seek (September 21—October 4) a redefinition of the Reichstadt agreement. In both Vienna and London (but not in
Berlin) the Russians proposed that: Austria occupy Bosnia; Russia occupy
Bulgaria; and the great powers send fleets to the Bosphorus to overawe the
Turks. Franz Joseph and Andrassy were favorable to the first of these propositions, but not to the second; the British were opposed to the second and

third. By sending Sumarokov-Elston back empty-handed, the Austrians decided against joining Russia in invading Turkey, but they made clear their
intention to remain benevolently neutral and left open the door to further
negotiations. In the superheated political climate at Livadia Alexander and
his advisers concluded that, if Austria would not become their partner in war,
she must intend to become their opponent.24 Under that supposition they
determined to test the loyalty of their German ally.
Bismarck had long anticipated and sought to delay the day when Germany
might be faced with the question Alexander now asked.25 Yet he was dumbfounded by the timing and tactlessness of its communication—orally through
a general without diplomatic experience. Nowhere in the diplomatic communications exchanged up to this point, furthermore, had there been any
hint that the Russians were considering war with Austria. Bismarck suspected
Gorchakov of setting a trap. "If we answer 'no,' he will use it to prejudice Tsar
Alexander against us; if we answer 'yes,' he will use it in Vienna."26 He would
have preferred an evasive reply or none at all, but Wilhelm feared to offend
his nephew.27 Bismarck recalled Schweinitz from vacation and sent him (October 23) to Livadia with the German response: In the event of a RussianTurkish war, Germany would urge Austria to keep the peace with Russia. But
if a break should occur between Russia and Austria, Germany would have no
reason to abandon her neutrality. If Italy and France should enter the war,
Germany might have to look after its own interests. If the whole of Europe
should combine against Russia, it would not be in Germany's interest to see
Russia's position as a European power seriously and lastingly damaged. Germany's interests would be just as deeply affected, if the integrity of the Habsburg Empire or its position as a factor in the European balance of power should
be threatened.28 In his memoirs Bismarck put the matter more succinctly:
"We could indeed endure that our friends should lose or win battles against
each other, but not that one of the two should be so severely wounded and
injured that its position as an independent great power participating in European affairs would be endangered."29
Bismarck's famous response to Russia's "untimely" question is a classic in
the history of balance of power diplomacy. Better than any other perhaps,

that document illustrates Bismarck's most characteristic political tactic: his
exploitation of conflicting interests (within a largely closed system) for the
creation of balanced options, which reserved to himself (and the interest he
served) the freedom to choose, even while denying it to others.30 In it he
demonstrated to the Russians—as he did also to the Austrians, when their
emissary called at Varzin—both the limits and value of Germany's political
friendship.31 Britain's return to an active role in European affairs enabled him
to think realistically about other combinations that might become necessary
in the continuing effort to keep Germany "one of three on the European
chessboard." The options he considered at this time as alternatives to the
Three Emperors League were, depending on the circumstances, Britain-Germany-Russia and Britain-Germany-Austria.32 Russia's reaction to his message
of October 23 could only have increased his readiness to consider the second
of these choices.
Both the tsar and Gorchakov made clear to Schweinitz and Bismarck their
dissatisfaction with the German response. "We expected great things from
you," said the Russian chancellor, "and you bring us nothing that we did not
know long ago." Gorchakov insisted that Germany should be willing to declare to the world that Russia had the right as the "mandator of Europe" to
30

See vol. i, pp. xxix, 80-84.
On Oct. 3-4, 1876, Bismarck received a secret visit from Baron von Munch, sent by Andrassy to sound out Bismarck's attitude in the event of a break between Russia and Austria because of the latter's rejection of the overtures brought by Sumarokov-Elston. The chancellor's
response was similar to that sent to Gorchakov via Schweinitz. Rupp, Wavering Friendship, pp.
194-197. What he told the Austrians he repeated to a parliamentary soiree on Dec. 2, 1876 (BP,
I, 118-119) and to the Reichstag on the fifth (BR, VI, 446).
3i
GP, II, 36. When Schweinitz visited Varzin (Oct. 10-12, 1876) to receive his instructions
for Livadia, he asked Bismarck what Germany would require "as compensation for our support in
the eastern crisis." Bismarck replied, "a guarantee for Alsace-Lorraine would be acceptable." In
the chancellor's written instructions (Oct. 23), however, Schweinitz read that Germany could
not give "contractual assurances that would lastingly bind us" to Russia. Hence he merely
sounded out Gorchakov about the possibility of a Russian guarantee for Alsace-Lorraine. Gorchakov replied that such commitments were "of little use." Schweinitz, ed., DenkwUrdigkeiten, I,
355> 359-362. Three years later, Bismarck claimed that in Oct. 1876 Gorchakov had rebuffed
his offer to go with Russia "through thick and thin" in return for the requested guarantee. Ibid.,

Bismarck's "alliance offer" of Oct. 1876. See the summary in Rupp, Wavering Friendship, pp.
202-209. Before beginning any serious action (for example, the war on Austria in 1866 and his
break with the liberals in 1878), Bismarck's practice was to offer to treat with the opposition, if
only to assure himself that no other option was viable. Such maneuvers were also useful for
unsettling the opposition and providing himself later with a countering reproach of the following
sort: "You complain about my conduct, but just consider how much better off you would have
been, had you only accepted the offer I once made you!"

put an end to "unbearable conditions" in the Ottoman Empire.33 With German help he wished to depict Russia in the coming war as the savior of Christianity and of western civilization itself. In the margin of the messages received from the tsar and Gorchakov Bismarck scrawled his reactions in three
languages: "Who is Europe?" "Qui park. Europe a tart—notion geographiaue."
"Redensarten."34
To the Kaiser he wrote, "I have always heard the word 'Europe' from the
mouths of those political figures who demanded from other powers something
that they don't dare ask in their own names."35 As Christians Germans were
certainly concerned about human suffering in other parts of the world. But
Germany was being asked "to engage its power, its peace, and its European
relationships" in behalf of causes in which other European powers had a far
greater self-interest. England, Austria, and Russia should be left to draw their
own chestnuts out of the fire. "We should not shoulder the cares of other
powers. We will have quite enough of our own."36 He assured the Russians of
Germany's "understanding" and "sympathy" for their cause in the Balkans,
urged them to get on with their invasion of Turkey, and pledged to assist in
"localizing" the war by keeping Austria and Britain neutral.37 He advised Russia to approve Austria's occupation of Bosnia and England's occupation of
Egypt. But he resolved not to involve Germany with Russia and England in
the "difficult question" of where the Russian army should halt in its advance
toward Constantinople.38

Russia's Road to War
In late 1876 Bismarck and Germany were the center of attention among European governments. Gorchakov's inconvenient question and his effort to get
Bismarck to provide Russia with moral justification for attacking Turkey were
just two indications that Germany, superficially isolated in May 1875, was
now the power whose support was most desired by all powers involved in the
eastern crisis. As noted, Bismarck was compelled to stave off dangerous overtures from both Russia and Austria, each seeking support against the other.
But he also refused Andrassy's proposal for a German-Austrian alliance to
hold Italy in check, on the grounds that such a combination would be interpreted in Petersburg as anti-Russian.39 In London Disraeli, grown distrustful

of Russia's aims and badgered by anti-Turkish agitation from "atrocitarians,"
broached the possibility of an English-German agreement to preserve the
status quo in the Balkans—and in Alsace-Lorraine!40
Disraeli's demarche inspired Bismarck to describe to the Kaiser and the
German foreign office his "fantasy picture" of the ideal solution: Bosnia to
Austria; Bessarabia to Russia; Egypt and Suez to England; Syria to France;
Constantinople, its environs, and the Straits to remain in the Ottoman Empire. "All Turkey, including the various peoples who live there, is not worth
so much as a political institution that civilized European peoples should destroy themselves in great wars for its sake." He was determined, nevertheless,
neither to take the initiative for such a settlement nor to put diplomatic pressure on any other power toward that end. Even though couched in the friendliest terms, such pressure could only harm Germany's foreign relations. He
could not conceive of any proposal that would elicit only applause from the
concerned powers and antagonize no one. 4 ' In accordance with this viewpoint, he gave the British only a hazy outline of his "fantasy," reproached
them for having ignored earlier proposals that Britain restrain Russia in collaboration with Austria and Germany, and warned that their refusal had compelled him to support Gorchakov's plan for joint diplomatic action by the
European powers against the Turks.42 Disraeli and Derby had to be shown the
cost of failing to respond to Bismarck's overtures.
On October 31, 1876, Russia gave the Porte, whose victorious army was
advancing on Belgrade, forty-eight hours in which to accept an armistice of
six weeks in the war with Serbia. The Porte yielded, and, on Britain's proposal, the great powers sent plenipotentiaries to a conference at Constantinople, ostensibly for the purpose of settling the Balkan war. Before the first
plenary session was held on December 23, Lord Salisbury and Ignatyev, the
British and Russian plenipotentiaries, hammered out on agreement, whose
principal terms would have preserved Serbia, given Montenegro its conquests, united Bosnia and Herzegovina into a single province, and divided
Bulgaria laterally into two provinces. The three provinces were to be autonomous, with elected assemblies and governors appointed by the Porte but approved by the European powers.43 Neither Britain nor Russia was sanguine
about the probable success of this program. Salisbury's purpose is said to have
been to split the Three Emperors League and deprive Bismarck of his central
position in European affairs, while Ignatyev strove to buy time for Russia's

lagging financial mobilization and obtain for Russia a European mandate to
make war on Turkey. The Porte had accepted the conference only under duress. On December 23, 1876, even as the conference began its first plenary
session, Turkish liberals headed by Grand Vizier Midhat Pasha proclaimed
with thundering cannon a liberal constitution for the entire empire. The new
governmental order, the Turks declared, would make the reforms planned for
the new Balkan provinces unnecessary. On these grounds an assembly of
Turkish notables, meeting in Constantinople on January 18, 1877, rejected
the Salisbury-lgnatyev program. The course of Balkan events had served to
stimulate not only a Panslav convulsion in Russia but also a national revival
in Turkey. On neither side was there now any mood for compromise.44
Oddly enough, Bismarck, representing the country least involved at Constantinople, became the scapegoat for the conference's failure. Alexander II
complained bitterly over Germany's "platonic" support at Constantinople.
The Panslav Ignatyev, whose skill as a negotiator won over Salisbury, insinuated that Bismarck, whose suggestions for dismembering the Ottoman Empire were widely known, was responsible for stiffened Turkish resistance.45 If
Ignatyev was the inventor, Decazes was the propagator of this charge. The
French plenipotentiary at Constantinople lost no chance to demonstrate
French support for the Salisbury-lgnatyev plan. At Paris Decazes intimated
to British Ambassador Lord Lyons that the German chancellor planned to
attack France in the hope of dissolving an incipient British-French-Russian
entente. Again Gorchakov saw his chance to make Bismarck the whipping
boy of European opinion. Europe was soon inundated with inspired newspaper
articles accusing the German chancellor of deliberately frustrating Russia's
just ambitions in the Balkans.46
In analyzing the European scene for his subordinates on October 20, 1876,
Bismarck declared that a rapprochement between England and France was
not injurious to the interests of Germany and the European balance of
power—"on the contrary."47 But a few months later he had begun to view
with concern the evidence of growing intimacy between those powers and
Russia. He suspected Gorchakov of intrigues in Vienna aimed at the fall of
Andrassy and inclusion of Austria in an anti-German coalition.48 These concerns were heightened by reports of continuing Russian and French troop concentrations on Germany's borders. In January and February 1877 the Prussian
general staff worked on plans for a two-front war against both countries.
France required only five days to mobilize five hundred thousand troops, it

was believed, while Germany needed ten. Moltke anticipated a decisive battle in Lorraine and a negotiated peace with France, after which German forces
could be turned against Russia.49 Despite Bismarck's warning, backed by
Moltke and Kameke, Wilhelm was disinclined to believe in the threat of a
French-Russian attack and agreed only with reluctance to strengthen the garrisons at Metz and Strassburg.50 A flurry of recriminations appeared in the
French and German press reminiscent of 1875. Again there was talk among
German military men of the advisability of a preventive strike against France.
And again Bismarck declined "to play God" by trying to predict the future.
"Every war, even a successful one, is a misfortune. . . . To try to drive out the
devil with the help of Beelzebub would be a dangerous game."51
In view of these uncertainties Bismarck turned again to Britain, inquiring
what the Disraeli government would do in the event of war between Germany
and France. Could London be expected to mediate? If Germany supported
British aspirations in the east, would Britain support Germany in the west?52
But again the British were unresponsive. Neither Derby nor Disraeli believed
in the likelihood of a French attack, and they concluded that the German
chancellor was whipping up another war scare like that of 1875. Did he look
upon Russian involvement in the Balkans as an opportunity to crush the
French? This suspicion was no more justified in 1877 than in 1875. Although
documentation on the episode is thin, it seems apparent that Bismarck was
again genuinely concerned that the French might seek to exploit Germany's
seeming isolation to launch a war of revenge. The fall of the MacMahon
government on May 16, 1877, did not assuage his fears. But he welcomed the
victory of Gambetta and the republicans at the polls in December, which
began a new era of reconciliation and even cooperation in German-French
relations.53 Among the first benefits for Bismarck was the resignation of Decazes as foreign minister and the removal of Gontaut-Biron, the much distrusted and probably maligned French ambassador, a favorite of Empress Augusta.
Even before the beginning of the Constantinople conference, the Russians
had begun to speculate on its failure. Bismarck's unwillingness to back Russia
against Austria had forced St. Petersburg to give up any thought of war against

both Austria and Turkey. The Russians appeared to have two options: either
come to terms with Austria over the fruits of a Russian war against Turkey or
give up the idea of such a war. By January 1877 the heat of public opinion
and Panslav agitation both inside and outside the government had made the
second option unviable. At Budapest on January 15, 1877, representatives of
Russia and Austria signed a military convention and on March 18 a political
convention, in which Andrassy exacted his price for benevolent neutrality in
the coming war. Under the first agreement Austria might occupy Bosnia and
Herzegovina but not extend its military operations into Rumania, Serbia,
Bulgaria, and Montenegro. The second agreement dealt with the political
settlement that would follow either a Russian victory or the dissolution of the
Ottoman Empire. Austria might annex, at a time of her own choosing, Bosnia
and Herzegovina (but not the Sanjak of Novi-Bazar, whose disposition was
left to subsequent agreement), while Russia would reacquire Bessarabia and
the frontier lost in 1856. No "great, compact Slavic or other state" was to be
erected in the Balkans. Bulgaria, Albania, and the rest of Rumelia "might be
constituted into independent states." Greece "might" annex Thessaly, Crete,
and part of Epirus, while Constantinople "might become a free city."54
Without going to war or even mobilizing, the Dual Monarchy was assured
of territorial acquisitions that would frustrate Panslav ambitions to unite the
southern Slavs. By assuming control later over Novi-Bazar, Austria-Hungary
could keep Serbia and Montenegro apart and also preserve for herself a sally
port into the Balkans; by foreclosing the creation of a large Bulgaria, she left
open the route for Austrian commercial expansion toward Salonika. The
gains Russia could make from the war were limited, regardless how complete
the victory and how great the sacrifice.
Through Ignatyev, who toured Europe's capitals in March 1877, Alexander
and Gorchakov made a final, vain effort to organize European powers either
to force the Porte to yield without war or to give Russia the mandate to conduct a crusade in behalf of Christianity and humanity.55 Bismarck urged them
to go to war but in their own interest. He recognized that some outlet had to
be found for the anger and frustration of Russian imperialists and Panslavists.
But he also wanted to prove to Russia Germany's loyalty as an ally, and he
expected that Russia's invasion of the eastern Balkans would trigger a division
of Turkish soil—the only way to resolve the crisis without a European war.
Neither the tsar nor his chancellor was eager to attack. Yet they had, under
the prodding of the Panslavists, followed a course that made war hard to avoid
when the Turks refused to yield to diplomatic pressure. Their military preparations, Bismarck sneered, had put the Russians in the position of the diner

who no longer wants the steak he ordered but feels compelled to eat it because
he has to pay for it.56 On April 24, 1877, the tsar declared war on Turkey.

Europe's Road to Berlin
Bismarck could regard the Russian invasion of the Balkans with relative equanimity. He had repeatedly assured Petersburg of Germany's benevolent neutrality and of his willingness to do what he could to block an anti-Russian
coalition.57 That Austria had exacted favorable terms from Russia for its neutrality meant that the Three Emperors League was as secure as could be expected in the ever-quivering balance of power. Russia's military involvement
in the Balkans diminished the possibility of her collaboration with France
against Germany. The only acute danger for Germany would come if England
should go to war against Russia to protect Constantinople and the Straits. To
avoid this, Bismarck continued during the first weeks of war to push for a
limited partition of Turkey. He seconded Shuvalov's advice to his government that Russia restrict its objectives to the annexation of Bessarabia, autonomy of Bulgaria, and expansion of Montenegro. To Austria he recommended
annexation of Bosnia, Herzegovina, and perhaps other districts. France, he
declared, had already received her compensation in Algeria, but might take
Tunis as well, if she finally abandoned Alsace-Lorraine. Italy might have a
"portion" of Tripoli. ' 8 Through Munster and Russell he suggested that Britain
accept Egypt and possibly even Syria, Crete, and Cyprus. To limit Russia's
advance he advised the British to occupy the Dardanelles. Again he assured
Derby of his desire for "an intimate and lasting alliance" with Britain, but
spoke of a "cordial and intimate understanding between England and Russia,
to which Germany would become a party."59 These suggestions merely filled
Disraeli and his colleagues with distrust. They suspected Bismarck of seeking
to embroil Britain in war with Russia in order to gain for Germany the freedom to attack France and perhaps annex the Netherlands.60 "There must finally be an end to this," Disraeli burst out. "I find him everywhere in my way.
. . . The man is a European nuisance. Bismarck, more than Russia, is my
problem, and I am firmly resolved to thwart him."61

* The Change of Front Begun, 1875-1878 *

During the rest of 1877 Bismarck largely withdrew from attempts to steer
the Balkan crisis. Comparative inactivity suited not only the diplomatic situation but also the precarious state of his health. We have seen that, after
another of his celebrated "resignations" (this one a charade), he left Berlin
(April 16) on another extended leave that lasted ten months. At Friedrichsruh, on brief visits to Berlin, and on travels to Kissingen, Gastein, and Salzburg he conferred with foreign diplomats as the Balkan drama unfolded but
made no serious effort to influence its direction. In June he drafted the famous
appraisal of Germany's situation in Europe known as the "Kissingen dictation," in which he described the "cauchemar des coalitions" that disturbed his
sleep, the "most dangerous" of which was Russia-Austria-France. Too great
an "intimacy" between any two of these powers would enable the third to
place Germany under "very painful pressure." "Because of my concern over
these eventualities I would regard it as desirable if the eastern crisis produced
the following results, not immediately but in the course of years: (1) gravitation of Russian and Austrian interests and mutual rivalries toward the east;
(2) cause for Russia to assume a strong defensive position in the east and on
its coasts and to need our alliance; (3) for England and Russia a satisfactory
status quo, which will give them the same interest that we have in the maintenance of existing arrangements; (4) a separation of England from France,
which remains hostile to us, because of their frictions over Egypt and the
Mediterranean; (5) such relations between Russia and Austria as will make it
difficult for them to launch an anti-German conspiracy to which centralistic
or clerical elements in Austria might perhaps be inclined." As he watched
and waited, Bismarck hoped that out of the confusion of motives and conflicting interests would emerge a "total situation" in which all European great
powers "except France" would need Germany and be kept from coalitions
against her by their conflicting interests.62 Short- and long-term objectives
were fused in a clear yet flexible plan for the pursuit of Germany's interests,
as Bismarck perceived them.
During the spring and early summer of 1877 Russian troops crossed Rumania and invaded Ottoman territory more quickly than anticipated. In London
the Russian advance was followed with mounting anxiety, scarcely mitigated
by Gorchakov's assurances that Russia had no designs on Egypt, Suez, and
(somewhat more vaguely) Constantinople and the Straits. Nor was an exchange of views between the British and Austrian governments on what the
two powers could accept in the way of a Balkan settlement imposed by Russian arms very reassuring; the British began to suspect the existence of an
Austrian-Russian understanding on the outcome of the war. On July 21,

1877, the Disraeli cabinet resolved to declare war on Russia, if Russian armies
should defy British warnings by occupying Constantinople more than briefly;
63
preparations were begun for ordering the British fleet to Constantinople.
But then, to universal surprise, Turkish resistance stiffened. At the fortress
of Plevna, Osman Pasha and his troops put up a resistance that stalled the
entire Russian advance from July 20 to December 10. The long delay embar­
rassed the Russians and relieved the Austrians and British. As the siege of
Plevna came to an end, the Porte turned to the neutral powers requesting
their mediation. Bismarck replied that Germany would mediate only if re­
quested to do so by Russia. "In view of the long border we share with the
tsarist empire, our relationships with Russia are much more important to us
than all of Turkey."64 Although increasingly anxious about Russian inten­
tions, the Austrian government was reluctant to join Britain in any action
until certain that Russia would not honor its secret commitments to Vienna. 65
On January 27, 1878, the Porte accepted Russia's peace terms and four days
later signed an armistice that halted the fighting, but not the advance of Rus­
sian troops toward Constantinople.
Within the British government there was no consensus about how to react
to Russia's progress toward the Straits—much to the distress of Queen Victo­
ria, whose anxiety over the Russian threat and British inaction reached a
feverish pitch. "In a cabinet of twelve members," Disraeli told her, "there are
seven parties or policies as to the course which should be pursued."66 Disraeli
favored a naval demonstration at the Straits in order to stop the Russian ad­
vance on Constantinople, which he now perceived as the "key to India." But
the lethargic Derby was immovably opposed to any warlike action—to the
point of collaborating secretly with Russian Ambassador Count Peter Shuva­
lov to halt the drift toward war in both London and St. Petersburg. That Lady
Derby was known to be relaying cabinet decisions and indecisions within
hours to Shuvalov heightened the confusion. The prime minister found it
necessary to bypass his foreign secretary by secretly warning Petersburg in Au­
gust 1877 that Britain would go to war if Russia should resume the advance
on Constantinople. But the tsar and Gorchakov, knowing the disarray within
the British government, could see no reason to halt after the fall of Plevna.
Having decided to go to war, Alexander had put aside his doubts about its
wisdom, comfortable in the thought that the monarchy was now united with
the Russian people in a fight for a holy, national cause. On January 23, 1878,

Disraeli succeeded in getting the cabinet to order the fleet to sail through the
Dardanelles. But even now the confusion in London continued. Twice the
fleet was ordered back to Besika Bay before it finally reached Constantinople
on February 15. Derby's resignation was accepted and then revoked. Embarrassment over this vacillation and the adverse reaction it produced from a
public already inflamed by "jingoism" forced the Disraeli government to assume an ever more belligerent stance. For weeks Europe teetered on the edge
of a major conflict.67
In the end the Balkan conflict did not become a European war because no
great power wanted it and all exerted themselves to prevent it. At San Stefano Ignatyev succeeded in wresting from the Porte a victor's peace, which
delighted Russia's Panslavists but seemed excessive to political realists like
Shuvalov. Britain and Austria found the treaty an intolerable affront to their
interests; to the latter it was also a betrayal of secret agreements and often
reiterated promises. Both governments were prepared to fight rather than accept Russian domination of the Balkans and the Straits. Since its army and
finances were in no condition to engage in such a war, the Russians had no
choice but to accept a European conference to revise the treaty. On March
6, Andrassy formally called upon the powers to meet at Berlin. After some
haggling, they accepted, and the congress was scheduled for June.68
That Berlin was selected as the site for the international congress that concluded the Balkan crisis was symbolic of the position to which Bismarck's
diplomacy had elevated the Prussian capital in merely fifteen years. The last
previous European congress had been held at Paris in 1856 to conclude the
Crimean War. On that occasion the choice of Paris had been looked upon as
a recognition of the new prestige of France under Napoleon III. To go to
Berlin—a difficult decision for the French government—was to recognize the
change wrought by German victories over Austria and France. But it was also
proof that the war-in-sight crisis of 1875 had been but a passing episode in
European politics. The neutral course Bismarck had steered since the fall of
that year in the eastern question had left him the only statesman in Europe
who, despite British distrust and Russian dissatisfaction, was presumed to
have the authority and relative impartiality capable of presiding over a congress to resolve the Balkan crisis and preserve Europe's peace.69

The Honest Broker
The task of presiding over a European congress could scarcely have fallen
upon Bismarck at a more inconvenient time. While relatively inactive on the
diplomatic front during the preceding year, he had been deeply engaged in
major actions in internal affairs. These were the months of his effort to reorganize the Prussian-German government, his futile negotiations for Bennigsen's entry into the government, and his continuing effort at "tax reform"
that ultimately produced the protective tariff. Immediately before the congress met occurred the two attempts on Wilhelm's life that led to dissolution
of the Reichstag and the beginning of an election campaign. As observed,
Bismarck's long leave (April 1877 to February 1878) had done little to restore
his health. He returned to Berlin too weak either to stand or work for long,
afflicted by sleeplessness, rheumatism, neuralgia, and shingles. He was not
eager to assume the task now thrust upon him, but accepted chiefly on the
insistence of Tsar Alexander. He anticipated being blamed by whichever
power was dissatisfied with the results.70 On February 19, he described the
role he intended to play in words long remembered. He would act, he said,
not like a referee but like "an honest broker, who really wants to get the
business settled."71
The business to be settled was a revision of the Treaty of San Stefano in a
manner favorable to the interests of Britain and Austria. Since Russia had
declined to go to war against those powers in defense of the treaty, she had
no choice but to permit such a revision, while trying to retain as many gains
as possible. For Russia the necessity of accepting the congress was itself a humiliation. If in Berlin the Russians were compelled to surrender at the bargaining table too much of what Russia's soldiers had won on the battlefield,
the tsarist regime would suffer a catastrophic loss of prestige. Before the congress met the Russians maneuvered to separate their foes by sending Ignatyev
to Vienna to learn Austria's terms. Franz Joseph and Andrassy flatly refused
to retreat from their interpretation of the Reichstadt and Budapest conventions. The Treaty of San Stefano had created a single Bulgarian state which,
roughly following the ethnic maps of the period, extended in the south to the
Aegean Sea and to the west across Macedonia to Albania. To Andrassy this
"greater Bulgaria" violated the prohibition in the Budapest convention
against a "great, compact Slavic or other state." A Russian occupation lasting
two years seemed to assure that the new Bulgaria would become a Russian
client state. The treaty, furthermore, provided for the enlargement of both
Montenegro, which was to receive a strip of Dalmatian coast, and Serbia,
which was allotted part of the Sanjak of Novi-Bazar. Andrassy objected stren70

uously to both of these arrangements. Austria, he maintained, must have the
right to occupy and annex not only Bosnia and Herzegovina but also the en­
tire Sanjak of Novi-Bazar, including the town of Mitrowitza. The Austrian
aim, he frankly explained, was to construct a railway to Saloniki and hence
secure Austrian political and economic dominance over the western Balkans.
To the same end the weakened Ottoman Empire must be left in possession of
Macedonia. In view of the bellicose attitudes in Britain against Russia, Andrassy expected to exact from Petersburg a high price for Austrian friendship.
But he merely drove the Russians to settle with Britain.72
After months of divisiveness and indecision in the British cabinet, Disraeli
took a firmer grip on British foreign policy. Although his old friend Derby still
clung to the post of foreign secretary, the prime minister in effect took over
the management of the Foreign Office. Steps were taken to strengthen the
army and to move forces from Britain and India to the Mediterranean. Within
the government there was talk of acquiring new bases in the Aegean, eastern
Mediterranean, and even the Persian Gulf. All of this was too much for
Derby, who appeared to be on the verge of alcoholism and a nervous break'
down. He resigned on March 28, to be replaced by Salisbury. In continuing
negotiations with Russia, the British demanded that the entire Treaty of San
Stefano be subject to discussion at the coming congress and that existing trea­
ties dealing with Turkey and the Straits be regarded as still valid until ex­
pressly changed by the signatory powers.73 In a circular dispatch of April 1
addressed to the great powers, Salisbury stated clearly Britain's objections to:
(ι) a greater Bulgarian state under Russian control with a large Greek minor­
ity and in possession of the Aegian littoral; (2) territorial rearrangements that
would give Russia effective control of the Black Sea; (3) imposition of a large
and crippling war indemnity that would give Russia coercive power over Tur­
key; and (4) and the whole combination of treaty provisions that would cost
the Ottoman Empire its independence, shift the balance of maritime power
in the region, endanger access to the Straits, and thereby damage severely
British interests in the Mediterranean.74
Although they refused to yield to British demands that they withdraw their
army from the gates of Constantinople (permitting the British fleet to with­
draw to Besika Bay), the Russians finally came to terms with Disraeli and
Salisbury in negotiations conducted through Shuvalov, who shuttled between
London and Petersburg, stopping off at Berlin to consult with Bismarck. In
an agreement completed on May 31, 1878, Britain and Russia agreed to re­
strict the southern and western frontiers of Bulgaria and divide the country

into two segments laterally along the spine of the Balkan Mountains, the
southern part remaining under nominal Turkish sovereignty but without
Turkish troops. In return, Britain accepted the expansion of Serbia and Montenegro and Russian annexation of Bessarabia, Kars, and Ardahan; Batum
became a free port. (Meanwhile, Britain had obtained Cyprus in a secret
agreement with Turkey.) Russian forces occupying Bulgaria were limited to
twenty thousand men and were to be withdrawn six months after the conclusion of peace. Informed by Bismarck of what was taking place between Britain
and Russia, an outmaneuvered Andrassy made haste (June 6) to accept Britain's plan for Bulgaria in return for British support for Austria's acquisition of
Bosnia (but without any British commitment on the future frontiers of Serbia
and Montenegro).75
These prior agreements eased Bismarck's task of brokering the congress, but
their vagueness left many problems unresolved. As president of the body, he
established the agenda and directed the flow of the deliberations. Before the
congress assembled, Russia agreed that the entire Treaty of San Stefano was
to be open for discussion, while Britain and the other powers agreed that
decisions must be unanimous, giving Russia the right of veto. Bismarck's procedure was to raise one issue at a time, beginning with the most critical (Bulgaria), invite the delegates to state their general positions regarding it, then
adjourn for private conferences between the conflicting parties at which differences were hammered out. When they had reached agreement, sometimes
with Bismarck's help, the issue came back to the full congress for ratification.
Although Bulgaria—its size, shape, and division—was the most important
problem, there were others of significance: the military and political rights of
the sultan in southern Bulgaria (Eastern Rumelia), over which the Porte retained nominal sovereignty; Austria's right to occupy and administer Bosnia,
Herzegovina, and Novi-Bazar; the frontiers of Serbia, Montenegro, Greece,
and Rumania; Russia's new borders in Asia Minor and particularly the status
of Batum under Russian rule; Britain's prior, secret acquisition of Cyprus; and,
behind the scenes, the compensation (Tunis) to be promised to France.76
That the Congress of Berlin produced a treaty that ended the Balkan conflict for the time being was largely owed to Bismarck's skill and effort. The

task was not easy. "Quite apart from the importance of the negotiations," he
said later, "it is extremely tiring to express one's self in a foreign tongue
[French]—even though one speaks it fluently—so correctly that the words can
be transcribed without delay in the protocol. Seldom did I sleep before six
o'clock, often not before eight in the morning for a few hours. Before twelve
o'clock I could not speak to anyone, and you can imagine what condition I
was in at the sessions. My brain was like a gelatinous, disjointed mass. Before
I entered the congress I drank two to three beer glassesfilledwith the strongest
port wine . . . in order to bring my blood into circulation. Otherwise I would
have been incapable of presiding."77 As on other occasions Bismarck knew
how to convert disability into asset. His health, he kept telling the delegates,
would not permit a long congress. Disraeli portrayed him pithily at one such
moment: "Bismarck, with one hand full of cherries, and the other of shrimps,
eaten alternatively, complains he cannot sleep and must go to Kissingen."78
This constraint permitted him to focus attention on and limit debate to the
really critical issues, those that could mean the difference between war and
peace. Discussion of details made him visibly impatient and gruff to the edge
of discourtesy. Where impasse threatened he was ready with compromises; if
need be, he could also threaten (once he met the Turkish delegation in full
uniform with spiked helmet). The forced pace brought Shuvalov and others
to the point of exhaustion. "No one has ever died from work," was Bismarck's
reply to their complaints. He dominated the congress—arrogant yet supple,
persuasive in three languages, always forcing the tempo, yet ever mindful of
his role as the honest broker. That the congress finished in twenty sessions
lasting exactly one month (June 13 to July 13) was owed to his leadership.
But there was, as Hohenlohe noted, a cost—a mountain of details left behind,
to be worked out subsequently by multinational commissions amid considerable rancor.79
In contrast to Bismarck, Gorchakov appeared feeble and somewhat senile,
capable of damaging but not furthering the work of his able subordinate, Peter
Shuvalov. His chief concern was to hitch his own reputation to the San Stefano treaty and saddle Shuvalov with the blame for its inevitable revision.
Andrassy was badly hobbled by strong opposition within Austria to his objectives. As a consequence, he supported Britain against Russia and relied on
British help in gaining the right to occupy Bosnia and Herzegovina. "1 have
heard of people refusing to eat their pigeon unless it was shot and roasted for
them," said Bismarck in disgust, "but I have never heard of anyone refusing
to eat it unless his jaws were forced open and it was pushed down his throat."80

Nevertheless, Andrassy achieved his most important objectives, including
the right to garrison Novi-Bazar. To Bismarck's relief the French representatives at the congress—William Henry Waddington, a Protestant and moderate republican, and the Count of St. Vallier, Gontaut's replacement as ambassador to Germany—cooperated in seeking a peaceful outcome. Naturally
the whipping boys of the congress were the Turks, led by Alexander Caratheodory and Sadoullah Bey. Bismarck often treated them with contempt,
rudely dismissing their objections and reservations as needless impediments
to the business at hand. If the congress ended in war rather than peace, he
warned them, Turkey would bear the cost of the ultimate settlement, whatever the outcome of the fighting.81
After Bismarck the most impressive figure at the congress turned out to be
Disraeli (Bismarck: "Der alte Jude, das ist der Mann"). Although unable to
communicate in French, he advanced British interests with considerable force
and skill, ably assisted in detailed negotiations by Salisbury. Under their leadership the British came away with the greatest gains of any power: Cyprus, a
reduction by three-fifths in the size of Bulgaria, preservation of Turkish sovereignty over Macedonia and the coast of the Aegean. With Suez and Cyprus,
British naval power now dominated the eastern Mediterranean, and the route
to India was secure. Russia received Bessarabia, Kars, Ardahan, and Batum
(as a free port).82 But the liberation of Bulgaria and the enlarged frontiers and
sovereignty accorded to Serbia, Montenegro, and Rumania were not enough
to appease Russian imperialists and Panslav agitators. They were offended
that Shuvalov had surrendered so much of what Ignatyev had extracted from
the Turks at San Stefano and that the Straits remained closed to Russian
warships. Above all, the Russians were indignant over the failure of Germany
and Austria to shield them from this disaster. They had succeeded neither in
gaining the mandate of Christian Europe for their crusade against the Turk
nor in securing the active support of their allies. Instead, Bismarck had remained strictly neutral, Andrassy had followed the British lead at Berlin, and
Russia had been isolated. The Three Emperors League appeared to be a broken instrument—seemingly beyond repair.83
Other consequences of the Balkan crisis and Congress of Berlin, nevertheless, approximated the favorable outcome Bismarck had forecast in the "Kissingen dictation" of 1877. No longer did he have to be concerned that Germany's partners in the Three Emperors League might become too intimate for
Germany's good. The failure of Andrassy's attempt to collaborate with Russia
in the Balkans had been replaced by the likelihood of perpetual friction between them and the consequent dependency of one or even both upon Ger81

man support and mediation. The cooperative conduct of French diplomats at
the congress had confirmed Bismarck's prognosis that a republican and anticlerical government in Paris would ease the tension between France and Germany. At the congress, furthermore, Bismarck finally succeeded in dispelling
the British government's perennial suspicion that the new German Reich and
its chancellor were a continuing threat to European peace and stability. For a
time Germany's "half-hegemony" over the European balance of power was
regarded with less concern in London, Paris, and Vienna. The new question
was whether Russian distrust and even hostility would become the critical
weak spot in German foreign relations.

Renewal of the Interventionist State

HE ASSASSINATION attempts of Hodel und Nobiling in 1878
were for Bismarck, though not for the Kaiser, a stroke of good fortune. At a critical time in his chancellorship they enabled him to
fight an election on the issue of loyalty, patriotism, and reverence
for the monarch, whose result extended by one more notch his control over
the machinery of government. They demonstrate again his capacity to exploit
the unexpected. Yet Bismarck was not one to depend on luck. In the economic and fiscal crisis of the late 1870s he already sensed an opportunity for
a major stroke in domestic policy that might achieve the objectives he had
pursued in domestic affairs since 1875. A few months before the attacks on
Wilhelm's life he had found what he believed to be the common denominator
for the many fiscal, social, and political fractions in his problem. It was tariff
protectionism.

Fiscal Crisis and Social Ferment
The chain of thought and action that led to the tariff act of 1879 began in
1875 when Bismarck, the issue of his retirement settled, resolved to seek for
the Reich a "powerful, unshakable financial foundation" that would give the
imperial government a dominating position over and an organic connection
with the state, provincial, and local governments.1 During the three years
that followed, a fiscal crisis developed in the Reich and in Prussia that appeared to lead away from this objective. Shrinking revenues and growing expenditures compelled the Reich to depend increasingly upon state assessments
(Matrikuhrbeitrage) and borrowed money to balance its budget. Once again,
however, Bismarck found in adversity an opportunity for progress toward his
goal, which had acquired by now a social as well as a political dimension.
Under the constitution the Reich's independent revenues were derived
from tariffs and other indirect taxes—chiefly on sugar, liquor, salt, beer, and
tobacco (in order of importance). Additional sources of income were profits
from the imperial post and telegraph systems, the state-owned railway of Alsace-Lorraine, imperial bank, and a few other public services (mint, printing
office, and patent office). Military success produced temporary financial gains.
The French war indemnity paid for the cost of the war of 1870-1871, for

liquidation of debts contracted by the North German Confederation, and for
extraordinary costs of the Reich during 1871-1873. Enough was left for the
establishment of several special funds: a war reserve, a disabled veterans fund,
a fortification fund, and a Reichstag building fund.2
After 1874, however, the depression began to affect imperial finances. Customs revenues declined from a peak of 122,610,000 marks in 1873 to
100,020,100 marks in 1877. Of this loss more than half (about 12,000,000
marks) was attributable to the reduction and liquidation of the iron tariffs in
October 1873 and January 1877. The yield from consumption taxes (tobacco,
sugar, salt, liquor, beer) remained relatively constant at about 130,000,000
marks, as did the 5,000,000 to 6,000,000 marks derived from minor sources,
such as the stamp tax on bills of exchange and on foreign lottery bonds.
Shrinking revenues were coupled with increased expenditures for new imperial agencies, for the publicly owned telegraph network, and, in view of the
mounting crisis in foreign affairs, for the army and navy. To cover the deficit,
the states were assessed 73,943,600 marks in 1873, a sum that sank to
67,144,300 in 1874 but rebounded to 81,108,500 marks in 1877-1878 and
87,345,500 in 1878-1879. In 1877 the Reich began to borrow, and by 1879
the national debt had reached 138,860,700 marks.3
Increasing assessments for the benefit of the Reich disrupted the budgets of
federal states. Under the constitution the states were assessed according to
population rather than ability to pay, which meant that small states with
agrarian economies had proportionately a much greater burden than their industrializing neighbors. But larger states also felt the crunch. Prussia, which
in 1873 enjoyed a surplus of 73,886,000 marks, had difficulty balancing its
budget by the middle of the decade. The Prussian treasury groaned under a
deficit of 30,310,000 marks in fiscal 1878-1879 and 73,240,000 marks in
1879-1880. Increasing payments to the Reich (33,383,400 marks in 1873,
41,615,100 marks in 1878) were not the only problem. The depression years
brought declining revenues from state-owned forests, mines, and railways.

More important, much of Prussia's income was derived from direct taxes (for
example, class and classified income taxes) more sensitive to depression than
the indirect or consumption taxes of the Reich. In good years no reserves had
been built up by the federal states; instead surpluses were used to retire debts,
reduce and abolish taxes, and increase the size of the bureaucracy.4 City governments were also in fiscal difficulty. In November I8TJ Bismarck received
from the mayor of Berlin (Hobrecht at the time) a cry for help signed by 880
communities. First submitted without result in 1874, the petition declared
that Prussian legislation had increased their burdens in many areas, particularly for higher education, without providing an equivalent increase in income. Over the years, in fact, the Prussian state had deprived the cities of
many sources of income, culminating in the abolition of the milling and
slaughter tax in 1873. They urged a revision of the building tax, now overdue
after fifteen years of economic growth, and the transfer of one-half of its yield
to the communal governments (Gemeinden), rural as well as urban. Only such
a massive infusion of new income could keep the cities financially afloat.5
In order to bear their burdens both city and village governments (the latter
were no less affected, merely less vocal, than their urban counterparts) were
compelled to resort to a highly unpopular and inequitable device, the imposition of surtaxes on the class and classified income taxes and on land and
building taxes. The amount of these surtaxes varied from region to region,
depending on many factors such as the needs of the governmental units concerned and variations in the tax base from which it was taken as a percentage.
In the rural east the surtax paid by landowners amounted to an additional 10
to 20 percent of the direct tax, while in the Rhineland, where tax assessments
tended to be low, the surtax could reach 500 percent. Trans-Elbian estate
owners, still unconvinced of the justice of real estate taxes as such, deeply
resented the surtax on the land and building tax. In rural areas with little
industry, estate owners had to carry a proportionately larger share of "the cost
for public services than did the bankers and industrialists who were their urban counterparts.6
In the landlords' view agriculture was the victim of the failure of the Prussian state to readjust its tax policy in harmony with the transition from agriculture to industry as the chief source of wealth in German economy. WiIhelm von Rauchhaupt, Junker landlord and Landrat, explained what this
meant. "For about thirty years our entire system of production has been
skewed so significantly toward the capitalistic side that the earlier foundation
of our tax system, under which landownership was regarded as the base for

our whole tax system, has likewise been skewed. Today the power of capital
has become so great and has surpassed that of landownership by such a margin
that landowners have even fallen into a considerable dependency upon capital. As a consequence it would in fact constitute an utter misunderstanding
of the taxpaying capacity of individual classes of the population in this country if we tried to continue the present system, under which everything is in
the final analysis based on landownership."7 Landlords like Rauchhaupt resented what they regarded as triple taxation on income derived from farming,
that is, the land and building tax, classified income tax, and surtaxes on both.
By contrast, income derived from industry was subject only to dual taxation
(industrial tax paid by business enterprises and classified income tax paid by
managers and investors). They demanded an income tax on corporate income, a tax on stock market transactions (Borsensteuer), and a special tax on
unearned income (Kapitairentensteuer).
In terms of ability to pay, neither landlords nor capitalists were the chief
victims of Prussia's antiquated tax system. Despite a fundamental reform of
the Prussian class and classified income tax in 1873, the poorer groups in
Prussian society were obviously overburdened. Although an income of 1,200
marks annually per household was regarded as necessary for a minimum standard of living, 6,242,853 persons lived in households classified by the tax
collectors in 1879 at less than 420 marks. The class tax ranged from 3 marks
in class one (2,697,365 persons in households classified at 420 to 660 marks
annually) to 12 marks in class four (290,065 persons in households classified
at 1,050 to 1,200 marks annually). Like all other taxpayers, furthermore, the
poor were subject to the surtaxes imposed by local officials.8
The assessed incomes were generally less than actual incomes, and for that
reason the class tax cannot be used as a true measure of lower class income.
That workers found the class tax onerous, nevertheless, seems evident from
the number of tax "executions" imposed on delinquents. During the years
1878—1881, the average number of persons subject to attachments by the tax
collector was 24.6 percent of class one, 25.8 percent of class two, 18.6 percent of class three, and 10.2 percent in class four. More than half of the
"executions" in classes one and two were fruitless. The statistics for the cities
were even worse: in Berlin, for example, the percentages of executions in the
first four classes were 70, 65.6, 41.9, and 14.3. Of 190,000 attempted attachments for tax delinquency in Berlin, 178,000 were without result.9 No less
damaging to workers' morale than the tax burden itself was the knowledge that
the tax rate (at most 3 percent) paid by the richest persons in the realm was

not much greater than their own. (The tax rolls show five persons with incomes between 1,080,000 and 2,400,000 marks in 1879.)1°
To Bismarck the growing fiscal crisis of the Reich and state governments
was not unwelcome. It created a financial need, the satisfaction of which
might achieve political and social as well asfiscalobjectives.11 By 1877—1878
the shape of the reform he intended to undertake had acquired greater definition. His fundamental aim was still the "financial consolidation" of the
Reich, by which he meant the acquisition of new sources of revenue (either
by publicly owned enterprises or new indirect taxes) that would permit liquidation of the state assessments (Matrikuhrbeitrage). But now he hoped not
only to make the Reich financially independent from the states but also to
make the states dependent upon the Reich. He sought new sources of imperial
income so lucrative that millions of marks in imperial revenues could be
shared with the federal governments. With these millions the Prussian government could begin step by step to liquidate (as state but not as local taxes)
the class and classified income taxes, land and building taxes, and their respective surtaxes. By ending the state assessments, he would remove from the
Reichstag the budgetary weapon that he had unwittingly yielded in 1867. By
liquidating the Prussian system of direct taxes as state taxes, he would reduce
the taxing power of the Prussian Landtag. By liquidating first the entire class
tax and lower brackets of the classified income tax, he could grant tax relief
to the Prussian working class and Mittehtand, both adversely affected by the
depression. By transferring what remained of the classified income tax and the
land and building taxes to local governments he could end the fiscal crises of
the cities and enable eastern estate owners, who controlled the county and
village governments, to relieve themselves of the hated surtaxes and conceivably reduce the tax rates on their property and income.I2
The critical factor in this complicated equation was, of course, the source
of the bounty that would make it all possible. Bismarck's solution was flexiblenationalization of a major industry, which, as a state monopoly, could produce sufficient revenue to carry the main burden of the reform; imposition of
indirect taxes on mass consumption items; or a combination of both. Initially
his greatest hope was for an imperial monopoly of the manufacture and sale
of tobacco, whose potential income was variously estimated at 130,000,000
to 163,000,000 marks. But his negotiations with Bennigsen in 1877-1878
showed that the tobacco monopoly was politically infeasible for the time being. Although reform was his primary aim in railway nationalization, he undoubtedly expected that a railway monopoly would be fiscally lucrative. Yet

the opposition of state governments compelled him, as we shall see, to abandon the project for the Reich but not for Prussia. Reinstitution of the iron
tariff was originally just one of several new indirect taxes he wished to impose.
But as the protectionist movement grew in size and intensity, Bismarck seized
on protective tariffs (for both industry and agriculture) as the main source of
the millions he needed to institute his general tax reform.
We shall see that tariff protectionism served many purposes for Bismarck—
economic, fiscal, social, and political. Recent historical writing has stressed
one of those purposes to the neglect of all others—namely, his so-called
SamrruungspoUtik (a term he never used), through which he is presumed to
have brought the magnates of heavy industry and big agriculture together into
a coalition, which, although founded on common greed, was politically useful
for the legitimation and consolidation of a traditional regime threatened by
the forces of "modernization." But Bismarck's social and political objectives
during the last decade of his chancellorship cannot be reduced to the contours
of this model. His mental processes—above all his capacity for calculating
options and combinations—were far too complex to be reduced to a single
formula.
If executed, Bismarck's plans for the nationalization of important enterprises and whole industries (tobacco, liquor, railways, insurance, and coal
mining) would have significantly enlarged the public at the cost of the private
sector of the German economy. His invasion of the capitalistic system would
have been costly not only for individual branches of the system but also for
its nerve center, the bourse. Like other landowners, Bismarck believed that
German capitalists did not carry a fair share of the state's fiscal burden. For
reasons of social justice as well as revenue, he too wished to impose taxes on
the bourse (Borsensteuer) and unearned income (Kapitalrentensteuer). "It is
only equitable that income derived from sources requiring no work on the
part of the owner should carry a larger share of the public burden than income
whose purpose is to compensate the recipient for work performed in gaining
it. The beneficiary of the first kind of income is in a position, indeed a much
more favorable one, to obtain the second kind as well, without sacrificing the
first. Income from capital can bear a higher taxation than that from work.
When invested in landed property, capital is in principle subject to taxation
as real estate, but not when invested in interest-bearing securities." The proposed tax, which was to be self-assessed, must apply to "all commercial paper
paying interest or dividends with the exception of mortgage obligations, since
the value of the latter has already been affected by the real estate tax on the
property pledged as security for the mortgage."13 Even as Bismarck moved

pp. 40-93. Unable to make any headway with tax proposals in Prussia because of Camphausen's
resistance, Bismarck launched his plan for an unearned income tax in the Reichsland, where he
was the only minister. Here he returned to an idea that he had defended as early as 1850 as a

451

toward tariff protectionism in 1878-1879, he planned new taxes that were
highly offensive to the business community that the tariff was intended to
protect.
We shall see that Bismarck never succeeded in instituting the whole, but
only parts of his "tax reform." What defeated him was the resistance of special
interests affected by his plans, the conflicts those plans aroused among interest
groups, and particularly the unwillingness of the Reichstag and Prussian
Chamber of Deputies to sacrifice the power they possessed in fiscal matters.
The coupling of political with fiscal and social objectives led repeatedly to the
frustration of the latter two, including Bismarck's plans to relieve the hardpressed German working class and Mittelstand from the burdens of the class
and classified income taxes.I4
The resistance Bismarck was to encounter from the Reichstag can be seen
in the fate of those new tax bills he finally extracted from Camphausen in
1877-1878. Only one was enacted, a playing-card excise tax of insignificant
yield.I5 Although national liberals recognized the disadvantages and even irrationality of the state assessments as a permanent system of public finance,l6
they were as reluctant to part with the weapon that had unexpectedly fallen
into their hands as Bismarck was eager to recover it. Bennigsen's negotiations
with Bismarck show that they were not insensitive to the urgency of new
taxes. But they demanded a surrogate for the parliamentary power they were
being asked to surrender. To achieve his ends Bismarck had to find issues of
compelling force, issues capable—either because of their appeal to patriotism
or to special interests—of overcoming the kind of resistance the liberal parties
showed when they emasculated Camphausen's tax program in March 1878.
The attempt on Wilhelm's life provided him with one such issue, the protectionist movement with another.

Progress toward Protectionism
In the Potsdam archives of the Imperial Chancellor's Office thick folders containing hundreds of letters, petitions, and other documents still testify to the
size and intensity of the debate in the 1870s over protectionism versus free
trade. Naturally, most of these documents stem from interests adversely affected by existing laws, particularly the law of July 7, 1873, providing for
deputy in the Prussian Chamber of Deputies. Georg Brodnitz, Bismarcks nationaiokonomische Anschauungen (Jena, 1902), pp. 106-107.

abolition of the remaining tariff on iron as of January i, 1877. But the agrarian and trading interests which, in alliance with free trade advocates inside
and outside of the government, had secured passage of that law were also
active in defending it. Although some documents on both sides of the controversy stemmed from individuals and small groups (including the magnates of
industry, banking, commerce, and agriculture), many show the steady growth
of organized agitation, culminating in identical petitions from different localities with thousands of signatures. The petitions for protectionism contain the
names and occupations of thousands of workers and artisans, who were apparently no less convinced than employers that their jobs and incomes depended
on shielding the country from foreign imports competitive with the goods
they produced. These massive files give the impression of a steadily growing
struggle primarily between the western and eastern provinces, between iron
producers, iron merchants, and iron consumers. The conclusion is difficult to
escape that no issue since the revolution of 1848, not even that of German
unification, had mobilized so many people, individuals, groups, organizations,
and interest groups in the effort to influence government policy.17
Within the government, the Kaiser was evidently the first to question seriously the wisdom of free trade. During the summer of 1875, bombarded by
contradictory petitions, he proposed a delay of one to two years in executing
the law of 1873 to make time for a study of conditions in the iron industry.
But Delbriick and the cabinet assured him that the complaints of the protectionists were unjustified.l8 Wilhelm mused over the "puzzle" that, while industrialists and bankers (specifically Abraham Oppenheim) wrote of "stagnation," his ministers reported "everything blooming." The government, he
concluded, looked to the past, Oppenheim to the immediate future.19 In 1876
Wilhelm spent the autumn season at his old palace in Koblenz, where he
apparently consulted with Ruhr industrialists. Afterward he returned to Berlin convinced that the iron industry was faced with "ruin" if the iron duties
fell on schedule. He summoned a Crown Council (October 24, 1876) to discuss the matter. While protesting that he was not a protectionist, the Kaiser
again proposed a delay in implementing the law of 1873. Once more the Kaiser's ministers opposed him. Abolition of the iron duties, Camphausen declared, had been included in the statute of 1873 to provide cheap farm machinery for eastern landowners to replace farm workers who had migrated to
the cities during the preceding boom. Industrialists had produced their own

"calamity" by an excessive expansion of plant and equipment during the
boom years. To extend the tariff would merely prolong the unavoidable agony
of their retrenchment. The government, Achenbach argued, would arouse
the dissatisfaction of consumers and inaugurate a major "struggle among interest groups" if it reversed the position it had established in the act of 1873
and defended in 1875 with the support of an overwhelming majority in the
Reichstag. Despite their expectations, the complaining interests would not
benefit from a continuation of the offending tariffs. Wilhelm was patently
displeased on finding himself isolated among his ministers. In the margin of
the official minutes of the meeting he restated his position.20 Never again in
the ten years that remained to him on the throne did he summon another
session of the Crown Council.
Bismarck was absent from Berlin on leave during both of these discussions.
At Varzin during 1875, he too began to express doubts about the economic
policies of Delbriick and Camphausen.21 For him laissez-faire had always been
a matter of pragmatism rather than principle. Dissatisfaction with liberal economics was one, although probably not the main reason for his decision at
this time to ditch Delbriick.22 Yet his attention at that time was more on
foreign-political and fiscal than on protectionist aspects of the tariff problem.23 Beginning in October 1875, he insisted that Germany's dignity required that its free-trade policy be reciprocated by other states. He demanded
retaliation against foreign governments that discriminated against German
producers with tariffs and export premiums. Otherwise his thoughts at this
time about tariffs were subordinated to the larger problem of a "thorough tax
reform" that would bring about a shift from direct to indirect taxes (including
tariffs). The drafting of such a plan, he insisted, was the duty of Camphausen
and his financial experts, not the chancellor.24

exports of heavy goods to Germany were relatively unimportant during the 1870s. French imports
of iron products, for example, amounted to less than 1 percent of German production, of iron
and steel hardware a little more than 1 percent, and of cast iron between 2.5 and 5 percent.
Bismarck's objection was more political than economic. He regarded French export subsidies as
both inequitable and degrading for Germany.

Within the cabinet a struggle developed in early 1877 between Camphausen, who clung to free trade, and Achenbach, who began to lean toward
protectionism. Both agreed with Bismarck, to be sure, upon the necessity of
retaliatory tariffs. A government bill to this end was passed by the Bundesrat
in December 1876 but died in the Reichstag.25 In April 1877 the cabinet took
over a bill to restore the iron tariffs initiated by Reichstag protectionists (Kardorff and Lowe) and, adding the retaliatory features of the preceding bill,
submitted it to the Bundesrat, where it passed with vigorous support from
Bavaria and Wiirttemberg. But again the measure was torpedoed by the freetrading majority in the Reichstag.26
During 1877, while Bismarck was at Varzin, protectionist agitation continued to mount. In October negotiations between Germany and Austria-Hungary for renewal of the trade treaty of 1868, under way since April, were broken off. Bismarck was determined not to accept a renewal that would leave
Austrian industrialists sheltered from German imports. His instructions to the
German negotiators may have been intended to shipwreck the discussions in
order to leave open the way for protectionist legislation in Germany. While
the Hungarians were free traders, both Bismarck and the Austrians wanted to
be free of treaty commitments in order to hike tariff rates. Soon afterward
Bismarck advanced toward protectionism by supporting Achenbach's proposal for a general inquiry into business conditions as the preliminary step
toward unilateral revisions of Germany's tariffs.27 In February 1878 a Prussian
proposal for an inquiry into conditions in the iron industry reached the Bundesrat and resulted during the summer in the appointment of two commissions, one for iron manufactures, the other for cotton and linen textiles.28 By
that time, however, Bismarck had already openly embraced protectionism.
After ending the Bennigsen candidacy and forcing Camphausen out of office in March 1878, Bismarck moved quickly to reorient the economic policy
of the government. On March 31, two months before the Attentat, he summoned Kardorff for a discussion in which he announced his intention to dissolve the Reichstag over the tariff issue. "Earlier I was myself a free trader,
being an estate owner, but now I am a complete convert and want to make
good my earlier errors," Kardorff recorded him as saying. His goal was "moderate protective tariffs and finance tariffs." "I want tariffs on tobacco, spirits,
possibly sugar, certainly petroleum, perhaps coffee, and I am not afraid of

grain tariffs, which could be right useful to us against Russia and also Austria."
He listened readily to Kardorff's plea for restoration of the iron tariffs, which
the deputy reinforced by pointing out to the owner of the Sachsenwald that
falling timber prices could be attributed to the lowered consumption of wood
in coal mining and of charcoal in iron manufacture.29 Five days later the
chancellor called upon the Prussian cabinet to consider reinstitution of the
iron tariffs as the first step toward a total economic reform program.30 Shortly
afterward the official Provinnal-Korrespondenz, to the joy of Ruhr heavy industrialists, advocated "protection for domestic industry." Free trade, it editorialized, ignored "the real needs of the people" and, in the absence of reciprocity from other governments, sacrificed their interests on the altar of
principle.3'

Freight Rates and the Price of Grain and Timber
Why Bismarck abandoned free trade for protectionism in 1878-1879 is still
hotly debated. Earlier German historians were inclined to see it as a brilliant
tactical maneuver marking his transition from liberalism to conservatism or
from Manchesterism to state interventionism. This view was popular among
those who regarded the state as the moving force in history and saw Bismarck
as the greatest practitioner of Staatsrason since Frederick the Great.32 Historians imbued with a materialist or sociological viewpoint, on the other hand,
are inclined to interpret the protective tariff as a feat of social engineering.
According to this view, his purpose was to weld together a new alliance of
special interests, between big agriculture and big business, in order to establish a new social foundation for the empire.33 Another opinion is that his
primary aim was to solve the fiscal crisis in a way that would consolidate the
Reich vis-a-vis the federal states and the German Reichstag.34 Each interpretation has some merit, but none suffices as a single explanation. All neglect

personal experience as a landowner and from the frustrations he experienced
in his railway policy.
During the late 1870s the prince was very disappointed by the "poor return"
from his investments in farming and forestry. "Apart from the paper mills,"
he complained to Busch in October 1877, "Varzin brings me nothing. It is
hardly possible to sell grain, since railway rates for foreign grain are too low.
The same is true of timber, which realizes very little, owing to the competition. Even the proximity of Hamburg to the Sachsenwald is of little use to me
at present."35 A year later Busch recorded the prince's reaction to a rumor
that he was purchasing an estate in Bavaria. "Bavarian estate! I have not the
least idea of buying one. I have lost enough on the one I bought in Lauenburg,
where the purchase money eats up the income of the whole property. How
can an estate yield anything when a bushel of grain is sold at the present low
price?. . . I said that long ago and tried to find a remedy. This is ruining our
entire agriculture." Busch then relayed complaints from farmers in the vicinity of Leipzig about the "intolerable competition" they suffered from Polish
and Hungarian grain "in view of the high wages paid to labor," observing that
"the people look to you for assistance." "Yes," the prince replied, "there will
be no improvement until there is an increase in railway rates or a higher duty
on grain."36
To assume that Bismarck consciously directed the state's economic policy
to promote personal interests would be unfair. What he did was to generalize
his personal into the common interest. He concluded that the scissors of cost
and price that sheared his profits affected agriculture as a whole—for him the
most important branch of the German economy and the economic base of its
social and political order. Experience strengthened his conviction that as an
economic producer he was in a better position to assess the empirical effects
of government policy than were the lawyers, judges, and journalists who dominated parliament and the academically trained officials who staffed the bureaucracy. He knew "where the shoe pinched."37 Whatever the experience of

other east-Elbian landowners,38 Bismarck himself felt the pinch of falling timber and grain prices in the late 1870s and was inclined to attribute it to foreign
competition. Initially, he blamed that ill not on low customs duties but on
lower freight rates enjoyed by foreign shippers.
During 1877-1879 Bismarck often complained about differential freight
rates, particularly for timber. In March 1878 he read to the Chamber of Deputies an official report that attributed a decline of 8,000,000 marks in timber
sales of the Prussian state forests in 1877 to long-distance rates favoring Hungarian timber merchants.39 Differential freight rates, he argued, had the effect
of "export premiums" paid to foreign producers selling in the German market.40 "If we do not get control of and regulate these utterly senseless railway
rates," he told the forestry expert John Booth, "we will go bankrupt in the
end."41 "The German farming population is close to ruin," he said to AustroHungarian Ambassador Szechenyi in late January 1879.42 It was a "question
of life and death." Only higher tariffs and reduction of differential freight rates
could save German grain and timber producers. "I myself have cause for complaint," he remarked at a parliamentary soiree in February. "To be sure, I have
my salary to fall back on, but agriculture must be helped."43 In March he
intervened at the Ministry of War to suggest that German lumber be used in
military construction. The durability of imported American lumber, he declared, was questionable; the government's purchase of foreign timber, furthermore, was a bad example for the country.44
Since 1873 the chancellor had battled in vain to gain effective regulatory
powers for the Imperial Railway Office, and in 1875 his decision to seek nationalization of the German railways was one of the principal decisions for his
change of front in domestic affairs. His purposes were several: to end financial
abuses and achieve uniformity in rates and coordination in services; to break
the influence of the "railway powers" over the nation's economy; and to give
the nation an added material foundation for its political unity. As shown
earlier, these efforts were frustrated by vested interests and advocates of free
enterprise. The greatest obstacles proved to be the German medium states,

which wished to control their own railways, and, to Bismarck's great annoyance, the Prussian ministries of finance and commerce, which for nearly two
years were unable to agree on terms for the cession of Prussia's railways to the
Reich. His discontent over these failures was one of the motives for his threat
to resign in March 1877. His determination to break the "passive resistance"
of Achenbach and Camphausen led to the decision to seek a separate "railway
ministry" and to the ultimatum of December 1877 to his Prussian colleagues,
in which action on railway policy was made a major condition for his return
to duty.45 "Private railways must be demoted from their position," he told
Baron von Mittnacht.46
Under Bismarck's hounding, Achenbach finally did produce a bill giving
regulatory authority to the Imperial Railway Office, but the Prussian cabinet
had not yet acted on it when the minister resigned in March 1878.47 His
replacement, Albert Maybach, was an energetic official who, as president of
the Imperial Railway Office during 1874-1876, pressed for both nationalization and a strong regulatory statute. After failing to attain either, he had
resigned to take an inferior post in the Prussian Ministry of Commerce. Now
he became Achenbach's successor, first as "Minister of Commerce, Industry,
and Public Works" (full title of the Ministry of Commerce) and, after the
division of that ministry in 1879, as "Minister of Public Works" (Bismarck's
"railway ministry"), a post he held until 1891.48 During the recurrent cabinet
crises of 1878 Maybach was the only minister who kept Bismarck's confidence. Although both preferred a nationalized rail system, they finally recognized that the resistance of the medium states was insurmountable. Sometime late in 1878 they gave up the futile attempt to sell Prussia's lines to the
Reich and concentrated instead on an alternative they had already discussed
in 1876: the purchase by the Prussian state of all remaining private lines
within its borders.49 Such a monopoly would, particularly in combination
with an Imperial Railway Office equipped by a new statute with effective regulatory powers, have much the same capacity to effect reform as would a nationalized railway.
During those months in 1878-^79 in which Bismarck abandoned free
trade in tariff policy, he pushed with equal vigor for the liquidation of free

enterprise in railways. If akin in philosophy—the rejection of laissez-faire and
revival of the interventionist state—these measures were unlike in their ef­
fects. While tariff protectionism favored the interests of heavy-industry capi­
talism, the regulation and public ownership of railways injured those of rail­
way capitalism. The former harmed, the latter furthered the interests of
mercantile capitalism. Both measures, however, benefited the interests of big
agriculture as Bismarck perceived them.
In early January 1879 Bismarck renewed his campaign in the Prussian cab­
inet and among German governments for an imperial statute regulating rail­
way rates. "The circumstance that such a major industry affecting the public
interest as railway transport is left to private firms and individual administra­
tions for exploitation in behalf of private interests without legislative control
has an analogue in the economic history of the modern state only in the old
practice of farming out the collection of taxes. If the collection of the class
and income taxes in each province or the collection of customs duties on
certain segments of our borders were left to exploitation by private corpora­
tions in the way that railway companies set standards, they would at least be
subject to rate regulations established by law. In our case the transport system
lacks, where railway rates are concerned, the security of legal regulation."50
On February 7, 1879, he officially presented the case for a regulatory statute
to the Bundesrat in the form of a "presidential bill." Despite some efforts at
reform since 1876, this lengthy document declared, the existing freight rate
structure, which listed 583 different standard rates and 1,370 exceptional
rates, did not meet the needs of German shippers for an equitable, compre­
hensive, and comprehensible rate system. This was especially true where
small businesses were concerned. A manufacturer in Cologne, for example,
whose goods were shipped in all directions, might pay as many as thirty-six
different rates. "Railways are public, monopolistic thoroughfares [licensed] by
the state and can only be used by railway entrepreneurs. By granting railway
companies the right to expropriate, to exercise police functions, to issue
stocks and bonds, etc., the state has abandoned part of its sovereign rights.
Sovereign rights are not granted in the interest of the railway owner, but in
that of the common good. From this it follows that the exercise of these sov­
ereign rights cannot be in the interest of the railway owner but only in that
of the commonweal. This means that the conduct of the railway business may
not be left to the arbitrary decisions of railway companies but must be regu­
lated according to the needs of the people and of public commerce. . . . The
facts are in any case that specially designed rates give a direct advantage to

individual industries, promote local production, even give birth to new industries. In this same way the prices of certain wares in certain localities can
be kept down. We cannot yield to the desire of individual railway companies
to regulate and control in every direction—something like an all-pervading
providence—the production and consumption of a nineteenth-century society with its manifoldly complicated factors and conditions. They must not be
permitted anywhere in the country to build up individual industries by artificial means such as exceptional freight rates and at the same time to depress or
even suppress industries in areas that would otherwise naturally prosper." Differential rates benefited the larger cities and were responsible for an unhealthy
concentration of industry and commerce in a few great centers that was both
"economically and politically" objectionable.51
During the first six months of 1879 the issue of protective tariffs dominated
German politics and the public press. Yet Bismarck, in a letter of mid-April
to Bavarian supporters, classified it as a secondary issue. "More important
than tariffs are the freight rates, which give [to foreign producers] import premiums that not infrequently amount to four to five times the 50 pfennig duty.
If we succeed in abolishing this injustice, I expect a greater benefit than can
be obtained by doubling or even quadrupling the customs duties now proposed. But, on the basis of prior experience, I have little hope of winning the
cooperation of the railway ministers of the larger federal states toward this end
and of getting them to agree to a common program."52 This pessimism was
justified. Although Bismarck, in an unusual appearance, presided over the
Bundesrat's initial deliberation over the rate regulation bill, the opposition of
all medium and some small states was so strong that he finally let the bill die
(June 27, 1879) rather than injure the federal principle by overpowering the
minority.53
Meanwhile, Bismarck and Maybach were moving at full steam to make
Prussia the "dominating railway power" in Germany.54 In November 1879
Maybach presented and defended a government bill in the Chamber of Deputies for the purchase of four major lines. Public ownership, he freely admitted, would harm the bourse by reducing significantly the number of securities
traded on the market. "I regard it as a service to limit the activity of the stock
market in this connection. I believe that the bourse acts like a poisonous tree
[Giftbaum] that casts its pernicious shadow on the life of the nation. For the
government to sever the tree's roots and prune back its branches is meritorious." Maybach's metaphor produced indignation in the financial community

but no rebuke from Bismarck.55 In fact, the chancellor threatened to resign
(his euphemism for a dissolution of the chamber) if the bill were delayed or
defeated.56 From estate owners and big industrialists—who stood to gain from
cheaper and more efficient transport—came strong support for nationalization. Among the speakers favoring it were Friedrich Hammacher and Louis
Baare, speaking in behalf of Ruhr industrialists (Verein fur gemeinschaftliche
lnteressen von Rheirdand una Westfahn). On December 12, 1879, conservatives, free conservatives, and national liberals passed the bill over the opposition of progressives, who deplored the consequence for free enterprise, and
centrists, Poles, and Guelphs, who were opposed to greater centralism and
"omnipotence of the state." The national liberal railway magnate Victor von
Unruh opposed the bill, as did some other Ruhr industrialists. But not all
railway entrepreneurs and investors were opposed; the depression had been
cruel to railway company profits, and some rejoiced that the state might compensate them well for surrendering depressed railway shares.57
The acquisitions of 1879, quickly followed by three others in February
1880, settled the controversy over whether Prussia was to have a publicly
owned railway monopoly. In 1878 Prussia had 4,800 kilometers of stateowned railways, in 1888, 22,420 kilometers. During that decade the Prussian
state railways produced surpluses of 666,000,000 marks, over the disposal of
which the Landtag had only partial control.58 Simultaneously, there was a
revival of interest in canal construction, which Bismarck also promoted and
Maybach carried out.59 The greatest achievement was the Baltic-North Sea
canal across Holstein, made possible by the conquest of 1864 and completed
in 1895.60 Maybach was one of the few public officials whose talents and energies Bismarck recognized.6" Yet, the prince was eager that posterity should
know to whom it really owed these achievements in public transport. Maybach, he declared, "was merely the sword in my hand."63
Federalism frustrated Bismarck's plans for a German national rail system
(the only imperial railway was that of Alsace-Lorraine purchased with the
French war indemnity) and even for an Imperial Railway Office equipped with

effective regulatory authority; yet the Prussian state "railway power" permitted him to attain most of the objectives he sought. Hegemonial size enabled
it to dominate the public and private railways of the lesser states in the north
and to make its influence felt on railway policy in the south as well. While
greatly increasing the economic and social power of the Bismarck government,63 railway socialism conferred benefits on private enterprise and the
general welfare. It ended secret rebates to favored customers and permitted
a more rational, stable, and equitable rate structure. Although special and
differential freight rates remained, they were used now for "mercantilistic"
purposes, including the protection of domestic and particularly agrarian producers against foreign competition. In that capacity they supplemented protective tariffs. One major objective, however, was not achieved. It was not
feasible to adjust freight rates in order to retard the growth of large cities. Not
even a state-owned railway system could afford the cost of becoming the instrument of an antiurban social policy.64

Bismarck's Motives for Protectionism
Once again it is evident how accurately Bismarck spoke when he said, "it was
not my way to be single-minded in political action."65 In a broad-scale "tax
reform" composed of protective tariffs, new fiscal tariffs, and new excise taxes
he found a common solution to many problems. It offered him the chance:
(i) to solve the immediate fiscal crises on three levels—the Reich, state, and
local governments; (2) to abolish state assessments and consolidate the Reich
financially against both parliament and the states; (3) to compensate for differential freight rates favoring foreign producers in the German market; (4)
to replace by successive steps direct taxes on real property and personal income with indirect taxes on consumer goods; (5) to provide class and classified income tax relief for low income groups; (6) to combat the depression and
the spread of socialism by increasing the prosperity of German business, providing more jobs and more income for workers; (7) to provide another common bond for big business and big agriculture, the new wealth and the old;

By 1897 the Prussian railways employed 402,119 officials and 65,634 technical personnel.

interesting example was his letter to Maybach, Apr. 19, 1881, in which he pointed out that
reductions in freight rates had increased the sale of coal but reduced the sale of firewood and
damaged the interests of the state forests and private forest owners. GW, VIc, 211-212.

(8) to drive another wedge into the National Liberal party and, by splitting it
apart, make possible a lasting progovernment alliance of moderate liberals,
moderate conservatives, and ultraconservatives; (9) to lead Germany away
from the politics of doctrine to those of material self-interest, which he regarded as a healthier basis for political life; and (10) to provide another national issue with which to seek the moral integration of a divided people.
These many objectives were not of equal weight. "We must throw a sop to
tariff protectionists; they are our surest allies in the matter of tax reform,"
Bismarck told Tiedemann in April 1878.66 His basic aim, in other words, was
not protectionism but realization of the fiscal-political program he had first
outlined to the Reichstag in November 1875. The appointment of four new
ministers to the Prussian cabinet in the spring of 1878 (particularly the replacements of Camphausen by Hobrecht and Achenbach by Maybach) gave
Bismarck the tighter grip on the Prussian cabinet that he needed for a fresh
assault on this fundamental problem. When the new cabinet met on April 5,
Bismarck's enhanced position vis-a-vis his ministerial colleagues was clearly
evident. The chancellor stated his intentions and issued his orders; judging
from the minutes, there was no discussion. He declared that "for some years"
the government's economic policy had not been fully in accord with his own
views. Bad health and "other considerations" had prevented him from effecting a change. Now he charged Hofmann, Maybach, and Hobrecht with the
task of preparing an "economic reform program" that would produce sufficient
new income from indirect taxes and tariffs, to permit either a reduction of
direct taxes or their transfer to local governments. Whether the reform should
be "prepared" by reinstalling the iron tariffs he left for later decision.67
In a message to Hobrecht, Bismarck spelled out in detail the "first stage" of
his general plan "to shift from the false path of direct taxes onto the smooth
track of indirect taxes." By raising 86,000,000 marks in new imperial revenue
he wished to abolish state assessments (70,000,000 marks) and distribute
the remaining 16,000,000 marks among the states. With its remitted assessment (42,000,000 marks) Prussia could abolish its class tax; with its share
(10,000,000 marks) of the remaining surplus, it could abolish the five lowest
brackets of the classified income tax. Henceforth the state should not tax
incomes under 6,000 marks. The beneficiaries would be the working class and
lower middle class. Delinquent taxpayers in the latter category, Bismarck believed, felt the threat of tax execution most, for they could descend the social
scale, while the simple worker with an income between 420 and 1,000 marks
could descend no further. At a later stage additional funds from the Reich
would enable the state to relieve the financial distress of the larger cities either

by more revenue sharing or by assigning to them the land and building taxes
and the remaining brackets of the classified income tax.
Such a far-reaching plan could be achieved neither overnight nor by any
single route laid out in advance. The possibility of failure in the Reichstag
should be no deterrent. "Politics is long-lived and requires plans whose fulfillment will take generations." As chancellor he would seize every opportunity
to advocate the necessary measures, depending on reason to triumph over
party politics and rhetoric. "Educated people without a trade, without possessions, uninvolved in commerce or industry, who live only off salaries, honoraria, and coupons will in the course of years either have to yield to the domination of the economically productive part of the population or surrender
their places in parliament. . . . Large, basic reforms have by their nature the
capacity to attract not only those who hope to gain from them a mitigation
of their current burdens but also all politicians who participate constructively
in the affairs of state. But also the number of egoistic interests grows the more
we present the voting public with healthy economic interests and withdraw
from the political pedantry of our parliamentary debates." The "parliamentary
system" might mean "ruin" in the end, but there was no substitute for it without resorting to "experiments" of whose absurdity history was a witness.
"What I can still do with my own feeble strength to hinder that our new
institutions are not shipwrecked by the impractical idealism of political children and doctrinaire intelligentsia and, finally, by the personal conceit of
parliamentary speakers who head the caucuses—with a consequent loss of
freedom and nationality, a relapse into particularism, and oscillations between anarchy and pure force—that I will seek to do at least as long as I live.
If I find no support in this effort, I can at least observe the fall of our new
grandeur more cold-bloodedly than can those who are busy bringing it
about."68
During April-June 1878, Hofmann, Hobrecht, and Maybach produced a
massive tax bill providing for higher imperial taxes and duties on tobacco
(regarded as by far the best vehicle for new income), but also on beet sugar,
spirits, coffee, tea, petroleum, illuminating gas, wine, and tropical fruit.69 In
the same meeting (June 6) at which he officially informed the cabinet of the
deputization of the crown prince and approaching dissolution of the Reichstag, Bismarck pressed the ministers to finish their deliberations on the bill and
present it to the Bundesrat "within a week." His intention was now to produce 120,000,000 marks in new money for the Prussian treasury, permitting
the "nearly complete" abandonment by the state of direct taxation.70 But the
ministers did not move so fast, and in early July Hofmann summoned a meet68

ing of the finance ministers of the German states to discuss the Prussian pro71

was quickly evident that Prussia's fiscal problems were shared by all other
German states. The Prussian delegation, headed by Hofmann, secured gen­
eral agreement on the proposed tax bill. The announced purpose was to liq­
uidate state assessments, relieve state and local budgets, and avoid imposition
of higher direct taxation.7* No mention was made, either in the Prussian bill
or in the reported results of the Heidelberg congress, of the tariff problem and
the necessity of reintroducing the iron tariff.
In their draft bill and in the discussions at Heidelberg, Hofmann and asso­
ciates avoided the issue of restoring the iron tariffs for reasons that historians
have hitherto not suspected. Statistics assembled by the Imperial Statistical
Office disproved its necessity! On June 9, Hofmann was compelled to report
to Bismarck that, judging from the statistics, "the abolition of the duties on
pig iron in [October] 1873 has not resulted in an increase in imports." On the
contrary, the statistics showed a decline in foreign imports from 14,882,411
Zentner in 1873 to 11,009,333 Zentner in 1874. In 1875 imports increased
to 12,512,898 Zentner followed by a renewed decline to 11,677,155 Zentner
in 1877. German exports of pig iron, however, had continued to mount from
3,087,366 in 1873 to 7,278,678 Zentner in 1877. Domestic consumption of
iron, moreover, appeared unaffected by the tariff reductions. From a peak of
144 lbs. per person reached in 1873, it had continuously declined to 80 lbs.
per person in 1877, "regardless of price." German producers, moreover, had
dramatically improved their share of the domestic market in pig iron and fab­
ricated iron products during the same period, despite the liquidation of tariffs.
Their production seen as a percentage of domestic consumption had risen
steadily from a low of 76 percent in 1873 to 114 percent in 1877. "In view of
the foregoing, the conclusion has to be drawn that the statistical material
assembled thus far, even despite the incompleteness of the production statis­
tics for 1877, would not suffice to substantiate the need for reinstatement of
the iron tariffs. . . . If your serene highness is agreed, a discussion of this
matter in the cabinet would hardly be advisable." It was better to await the
outcome of the inquiry into industrial conditions ordered by the Bundesrat.

Central Federation of German Industrialists.74 In addition, he secured detailed advice from various individuals: Wilhelm von Kardorff, leader of the
free conservatives; Ministerial Counselor Georg von Mayr, whose lengthy
memorandum of April 2 on taxes and tariffs and on revenue sharing between
the Reich, states, and local governments seems to have provided the basis for
the program Bismarck expounded in the cabinet meeting of April 5; Baron
Varnbiiler, Wiirttemberg's delegate to the Bundesrat, who supplied him on
April 18 with a detailed memorandum on tax and tariff policy;75 Count Guido
Henckel von Donnersmarck, Silesian estate owner and big industrialist, from
whom he received two memoranda and with whom he appears to have conferred in April and June 1878;76 and Tiedemann himself, an ardent protectionist, who had already supplied Bismarck in August 1876 with two memoranda on the necessity of keeping the iron tariffs and who, as head of
Bismarck's personal secretariat (Chef der Reichskanzlei), was in constant contact with the chancellor wherever he was at the moment.77
Bismarck found these sources more persuasive than the statistics Hofmann
sent him on June 9. "The more Bismarck delved into the details of individual
branches of industry, the clearer he came to understand the general emergency," so Tiedemann reported years later. "His thoughts centered on one
basic question—where to insert the lever to obtain relief. After a few weeks
he found the answer. The new system of our political economy stood in broad
outline before his eyes. The formula on which it was built was basically very
simple and yet surprising to a high degree. It was the protection of all productive labor. Previously the most zealous advocates of tariff reform demanded
only the protection of industry. No one had thought of including agriculture.
But the prince recognized, with his clear vision, the common interests of
both."78 What the prince recognized was clearly not an economic reality,
which his own statistics refuted, but a political opportunity. By extending his
"fiscal reform" to include protectionism not only for industry but also for agriculture, he had the chance to mobilize in its behalf the most powerful interest groups in German economic and social life. Protective tariffs, furthermore, were for Bismarck finance tariffs. Here he foresaw a new source of
revenue for the Reich that could replace his plan for a tobacco monopoly
(whose acceptance by the Reichstag at this time appeared unlikely) as a

source of revenue with which to carry forward his general plan for tax reform
in Prussia.
When the newly elected Reichstag assembled in the fall, the antisocialist
law was obviously not to be its only fruit. On October 17, 1878, a coalition
of 204 deputies—a majority in the chamber—issued a declaration favoring
both industrial and agrarian protectionism. The coalition dubbed itself the
"Free Economic Association of the Reichstag" and was chaired by Baron
Friedrich von Varnbuler, a Wurttemberg statesman and long-time advocate
of tariff protectionism. Included in it were 87 centrists, 36 conservatives, 39
free conservatives, and 27 liberals—a remarkable combination.79 Bismarck
was now ready to move. On October 25 he informed Varnbuler of his intent
to revise the entire tariff system.80 Three days later he dispatched to the German governments the first statement of his program and its rationale.81 On
November 12 he formally proposed that the Bundesrat create a Tariff Commission to prepare the new legislation.82 On December 15 he outlined to the
commission his views on the scope of the projected revision. When published
on December 25, this "Christmas present" produced a sensation. For the first
time the wide ramifications of the government's tariff revision became known
to the public and the affected interests.83
The message of December 15 shows that the fiscal-political motive was still
foremost in Bismarck's thought. "My primary interest is financial reform: reduction of the burden of direct taxes through an increase in the Reich's income from indirect taxes."84 His basic arguments for this reform were those
advanced earlier—but with added nuances and changes in emphasis. Indirect
taxes were less oppressive than direct ones, which undermined the lower middle class (income to 6,000 marks). The purpose was not to increase the total
income of the state, but to shift the tax burden and make it less visible. Germany lagged behind other major European states in exploiting customs revenue. To protect individual industries smacked of privilege and aroused the
resentment of the unprotected. What he proposed was protection for German
production "in its entirety." To place it on a somewhat more favorable basis
than foreign production was an act of "justified national egoism."85
The burden of new tariffs would be borne not by German consumers, he
insisted, but by foreign producers who would absorb the tax rather than withdraw from the German market. Only a "small minority" of the German population would not benefit—those who consumed but did not produce, that is,

persons on fixed incomes derived from annuities, salaries, and fees, a category
that included most lawmakers and state officials. But even they would benefit
in the end from the greater prosperity of the producing classes. He questioned
the assumption that higher tariffs would result in higher prices, asserting that
the abolition of urban milling and slaughter taxes in 1873 had not resulted in
cheaper bread and meat. Other factors affected consumer prices more than
tariffs; for example, differential railway rates had the effect of "import premiums" for foreign producers. "I am also convinced, therefore, that a revision
of railway freight rates must necessarily go hand in hand with the revision of
customs tariffs. The individual states and private railways cannot keep forever
the right to compete at will with the legislative power of the Reich, to neutralize arbitrarily the commercial policy of the allied governments and the
Reichstag, and subject the nation's economic life to the oscillations that necessarily result from higher and changing import premiums for individual
items."86

Poschinger, ed., Voltewirth, I, 176. In a letter to Maybach on Nov. 21, 1878, Bismarck
reiterated his view that abolition of "import premiums" in the form of differential freight rates
promised "greater success" in protecting domestic industry than the "small protection" to be
afforded by the new ad valorem duties on all incoming goods, which he, Hobrecht, Stolberg, and
Friedenthal regarded as a "finance tariff." GW, VIc, 126.

Triumph of Protectionism
Forging the Tariff Bill
tf-ζύΕ^) N NOVEMBER 6, 1878, Bismarck gave his only daughter, Marie, in
^ R i e ^ marriage to Count Kuno zu Rantzau, secretary of legation in the
^ J v J O r German foreign office, at a ceremony in the salon of the chancel^ 0 " y lery. The Kaiser used the occasion to present the chancellor with
the Grand Cross of the Order of the Red Eagle, embellished with crown,
scepter, and sword—the symbols of Prussia's power—in recognition of his
achievements at the Congress of Berlin and in securing passage of the antisocialist law.' Six days later the chancellor left Berlin for another period of
recuperation at Friedrichsruh. He hoped to return by December 5 to witness
Wilhelm's triumphal reentry into Berlin, celebrating the monarch's recovery
and resumption of power. But on December 3 he had to request four to six
more weeks "in work-free isolation and forest air" in order to arm himself for
the coming battle for fiscal reform in the Reichstag. His condition, he ex­
plained, was worse than it had been in September at the end of his Gastein
cure—undermined more by ministerial squabbles than by difficulties with par­
liament or by his exertions during the congress. "If I cannot finally have at
least a few weeks of complete rest, I must give up my position quite apart from
whether I want to." 2
Bismarck remained at Friedrichsruh until February 5, 1879, but his rest was
hardly "absolute." Judging from the number of documents he dictated and
visitors he received (ambassadors, ministers, Reichstag deputies), he was a
busy man. In January Lucius found him "reasonably well" and deep in the
study of customs and tariff questions. "It is astounding with what energy he is
working his way into this, for him, almost unknown material. He is very se­
rious about his projects and may underestimate the difficulties in his way. He
attributes a lot to lack of goodwill on the part of his coworkers that actually
lies in the difficulty of the subject itself. He threatens resignation or another
dissolution."3 Tiedemann, who shuttled back and forth between Berlin and
Friedrichsruh, bearing threats and instructions, had a similar impression.
"The prince is in a very belligerent mood, believes that a lot of dynamite will

have to be used during the year. Dissolution of the Reichstag, perhaps also
dissolution of the cabinet. If his ideas about tax and tariff policy encounter
opposition from Prussian ministers, he will return to Berlin, summon a cabinet meeting, and raise the cabinet question. If the ministers do not go along
with him, he will request that they look for other posts and will form a new
cabinet even if he has to fill the vacant posts with candidates from the ranks
of junior officials [Assessoren]. The Kaiser agrees with him."4
During the first half of 1879 Bismarck, although heavily engaged in political activity, had no complaints about his health as far as the record shows.5
Nothing appears to have altered his good disposition—neither the sprained
arm and thumb suffered in a fall from steps two days after his return to Berlin
nor the severe cold in late February that prevented him from attending the
funeral of his old friend and ally Field Marshal Roon.6 Political frictions of
the kind that often disturbed Bismarck's equipoise were not lacking—difficulties with Varnbuler over the tariff bill; the Reichstag's resistance to the government's attempt to restrict parliamentary freedom of speech (Maulkorbgesetz); the unwillingness of any Reichstag caucus to permit imprisonment of
two social democratic deputies, Friedrich Fritzsche and Wilhelm Hasselmann,
while parliament was in session. But none appears to have fundamentally affected his nervous system. Guests at his parliamentary dinner on February 15
found him "notably fresh." No "trace" was to be seen of his "well-known
nervousness."7 In early May Bennigsen judged him "very well and cheerful,
full of enterprise."8 After three years of groping, Bismarck had found the
weapon with which to flail his foes. As in 1870, the smell of an approaching
victory sent adrenaline coursing through his veins. The chance to manipulate
the cabinet, Bundesrat, Reichstag, and political parties by mobilizing economic interest groups in behalf of his objectives repressed his hypochondria
and galvanized his energies. Once more he had a firm grip on the wires that
made the puppets dance.
While the Prussian cabinet had accepted the tax and tariff program approved at Heidelberg, opinions were divided on protectionism. Hobrecht's
liberalism led him to oppose it; yet the finance minister lacked both firmness
and, by his confession, a grasp of the technical side of public finance. More
serious was the opposition of Minister of Agriculture Friedenthal—the SiIe4

sian estate owner, whom Bismarck had so recently praised as the only cabinet
member besides himself versed in practical affairs. Among the state governments views were also mixed. Saxony and Brunswick favored the Bismarck
program, while Baden, Oldenburg, and the Hanseatic cities opposed it. Other
governments wavered between these poles; ministers of the critical states of
Wiirttemberg and Bavaria, for example, were divided and the outcome uncertain.9
The general confusion mirrored the mixed reactions of the affected interests toward Bismarck's program of universal protection. Merchants who subsisted on the export-import trade (the Hanseatic cities) and on the transit
trade (Konigsberg, Danzig, Stettin) were naturally unshakable in their loyalty
to the principles of free trade. Industrialists (iron, steel, machines), who had
long been eager to wall out foreign competitors, were shocked to learn that
their own arguments could be used in behalf of farmers and estate owners.
Their aim was higher prices, not higher costs. If the worker paid more for a
loaf of bread, his income would ultimately have to rise. What came in the
front door might well go out the back. Agrarian producers, on the other hand,
were not happy over the prospect of higher prices for the manufactured articles they purchased. Those landlords still committed to free trade had to be
convinced that the danger of massive imports from the United States and
elsewhere was real and that their future lay in domination of the domestic
market. Manufacturers dependent upon imported raw materials (for example,
Bavarian breweries processing Austrian barley) faced the prospect of higher
costs. Every producer, whether industrial or agrarian, who had markets abroad
was apprehensive that foreign governments would retaliate. Bismarck's argument that foreigners would bear most of the burden of protectionist duties was
enticing, but not universally convincing.IO
Bismarck's tactics were the familiar ones of seduction, division, public pressure, and the threat of other options. His tariff program, he declared, was like
a Christmas table laden with gifts for everyone, including toy rattles for the
children.11 To the many citizens and organizations that wrote him to deplore
the state of the economy, he began to send personal replies, insisting on the
injustice of direct taxation, on the need to protect agriculture as well as industry, and on the virtues of shifting the fiscal burden to foreign producers

and of taking away the "import premiums" they enjoyed through differential
freight rates. These Bauembriefe, as they came to be called, were released to
the press and received wide publicity.I2 In dealing with Prussian ministers and
federal states the prince resolutely insisted on the indivisibility of his program.
Protection for industry, he warned Varnbuler and company, depended on pro­
tection for agriculture. If denied the latter, he would "try it again with the
free traders."13 He was equally firm with those who, like Hobrecht, wished to
separate the finance tariffs, on whose necessity there was general agreement,
from the protective tariffs, on which opinions varied. To keep the latter leg­
islation under his control he presented it as a "presidential bill," the device
developed by Delbriick that Bismarck had earlier castigated.I4
The bill was developed by the Tariff Commission, and Bismarck's first task
was to manipulate the deliberations of that body to produce the desired result.
Of the fifteen members, three were appointed by the chancellor, three by
Prussia, two by Bavaria, and one each by Wurttemberg, Saxony, Mecklen­
burg, Hesse, Baden, Weimar, and by the Hanseatic cities collectively. Bis­
marck's choices as imperial delegates were Tiedemann, his personal adjutant,
Emil von Burchard, head of the Imperial Treasury, and as chairman (a bril­
liant choice as events were to prove) Varnbuler, the most prominent spokes­
man for industrial protectionists in the Reichstag. While the commission sat,
Bismarck was in frequent contact with Tiedemann and Varnbuler.I5 To dom­
inate the body, they required two votes in addition to those of the Reich and
Prussia. Since the majority favored protective duties for industry, Bismarck's
tactic was to force consideration of the agrarian tariffs first. The message was
clear: the states would have to swallow the latter to get the former. The chan­
cellor advocated a single duty of 10 marks per ton on all imported grains, but
Varnbuler insisted on 5 marks for rye and corn, and Bismarck had to yield in
order to gain Wiirttemberg's vote. When agrarian Mecklenburg deserted the
free-trading ranks, a majority of eight was secured for the 5 mark rate. The
proposed duty on pig iron was 10 marks per ton, the amount desired by the
Association of German Iron and Steel Industrialists, but 4 marks higher than
that recommended by the Central Federation of German Industrialists. Ba­
varia, Saxony, Hesse, and Baden held out for 6 marks, but Weimar and again

Wurttemberg provided the necessary eight votes for the majority. These were
the critical issues; other duties were accepted with less difficulty.l6
Another Bismarck tactic was speed. The protectionist movement had provided momentum; now the moment had come to act before the free traders
could organize and ally with those who supported protection for some products but not for others. Working under forced draft, the Tariff Commission,
which had assembled on January 3, completed the presidential bill on March
26. For weeks Bismarck had again been stoking the steamroller in order to
flatten all obstacles in the Bundesrat. He warned the state governments of the
dangers of socialism, of the need for monarchical solidarity, and of the need
to combat radicalism by swift action to overcome the depression.17 By the
time the Bundesrat received the bill, groused the Hamburg delegate, nothing
was left to do but vote. The chancellor himself presided over the crucial sessions, and on April 4 when the discussion ended, only Oldenburg and the
Hanseatic cities voted in the negative. The only significant amendment was
one Bismarck proposed—the so-called "retaliatory paragraph" authorizing the
Bundesrat to double the duties against foreign states that discriminated
against German products. Among the measures forced upon the Bundesrat
that day was a resolution requiring that the bill go "to the Reichstag as soon
as possible." But during the very hour of its passage the Reichstag deputies,
knowing that the tariff bill was on its way, voted to recess for a month. l8 The
steamroller ground to a halt.

The Liberals React
The protection of agriculture was Bismarck's child. It is true that the protectionist movement had made progress among German landowners in recent
years. The Association of Tax and Economic Reformers, the economic counterpart of the new German Conservative party, was founded on a free-trade
program in 1876, but shifted to low finance tariffs in 1877 and to protectionism in 1878-1879. The association was composed of about 700 landowners,
many of whom were among the 250 "owners of larger estates" that composed
the Congress of German Landowners, which on February 24, 1879, also embraced the protectionist cause.19 Both organizations, earlier staunchly antiindustrialist, entered hesitantly into an alliance with the Central Federation
of German Industrialists to support the Bismarck program. The agreement

was one of principle, not detail, for each pressure group had an interest in
holding down the duties demanded by the other. In 1878-1879 the bond
between big agriculture and big business was by no means firm. Without Bismarck's sponsorship it might not have endured.
German agriculture, furthermore, did not speak with a single voice. In late
January 1879 the German Council on Agriculture, elected in 1877 by regional associations throughout the country, voted for fiscal and against protective tariffs.20 Among east-Elbian landowners there was still a strong commitment to free trade, for many continued to profit from exports. In the
transit ports of the Baltic the hard wheat grown on Russian plains had to be
mixed with German soft wheat before shipment to the flour mills of western
and southern Europe. By the 1870s, moreover, some farmers of the eastern
region were raising livestock for the slaughterhouses of Berlin and other cities
and required cheap feed. Early in 1879 the diets of the provinces of East and
West Prussia rejected protectionism, as did the farmers' associations of Brandenburg, Konigsberg, and Silesia. Meadows predominated over grain fields in
northwestern Germany, and the cattle breeders and dairy farmers of that region were interested in exports and in low-priced feed. Hence the parliaments
of the federal states Lippe and Oldenburg also rejected protectionism. Only
in the industrial regions of Upper Silesia, Saxony, and Rhineland-Westphalia, where rural and urban prosperity were closely linked, was there solid support for both agrarian and industrial protectionism. In Baden and Wiirttemberg, where industrialization was less pronounced and small subsistence and
livestock farms were common, opinions were contradictory and ambivalent.
The same was true in Bavaria, where farms varied widely in size and product.21
Where parliament was concerned the vital question was how the National
Liberal party would react. "What do you say to the newest Bismarck?" Miquel
inquired of Bennigsen in late December 1878. "This chess move is intended
to bring landowners and industry under one hat and probably will. The situation is for us extremely difficult, and I am very uncertain whether the liberal
middle class, disunited as it is, will be equal to the task."22 Six weeks later

and eastern Europe) by showing that the interests of most were still export oriented and that their
views reflected their interests. Yet he may have overstated his case. How without statistical verification he can assert that the "majority" of German farmers had "a very small interest in a duty
on gram" (p. 125) is hard to see. Hardach's basic finding—that Bismarck was decisive in mobilizing the protectionist movement and that he did so for fiscal and political purposes—does not
differ much from that of Lambi. See Lambi, Free Trade and Protection, pp. iopff.

Miquel, who as mayor of Osnabruck in Hanover was in a good position to
observe, reported the new alliance as an accomplished fact. "Here industrialists and agrarians have gained the upper hand completely. Throughout the
west as well, as I hear from every side."23 Those on the left wing of the party
also felt the shock waves from Bismarck's action. "The Bismarck system,"
Forckenbeck wrote to Stauffenberg, "is developing with fearsome speed just
as I always feared. Universal military conscription, unlimited and excessive
indirect taxes, a disciplined and degraded Reichstag, and a public opinion
ruined and made powerless by the struggle between all material interests—
that is certainly the politics of popular impotence, the end of any possible
development toward constitutional freedom, and at the same time a terrible
danger for the entire Reich and the new imperial monarchy. Is the National
Liberal party a suitable instrument to combat such dangers with its present
politics, its present program and its present composition? Will we not be led
deeper and deeper into the quagmire? Has pure opposition not become a
duty?"2"
When the Reichstag convened in mid-February 1879, the national liberals
abruptly rejected overtures from the two conservative parties and succeeded
in reelecting Forckenbeck as president and Stauffenberg as first vice-president.25 They combined with progressives and centrists, moreover, to reject
the government's bid to arrest the two social democratic deputies, Fritzsche
and Hasselmann, who had dared to take their seats in defiance of a decree
banning socialist agitators from Berlin. In early March, moreover, the same
combination handed the government another sharp defeat by voting down a
presidential bill that would have empowered the Reichstag to censure radical
deputies who "misused" the tribune to express their views. Under this "muzzle
act," as it was dubbed, the chamber could have expelled recalcitrant deputies,
excised speeches from the stenographic record, and forbidden their publication in the public press.26 Bismarck found this respect for civil and parliamentary rights "irritating" and his disparaging remarks about judges who were
more interested in protecting criminals than in protecting society provoked a
nasty exchange with Lasker, himself a judge, that even Lucius found harmful
for the conduct of parliamentary business.2?
That the National Liberal party was not now, if indeed it ever had been, a
"suitable instrument" for systematic opposition was quickly evident when it
confronted the tariff issue. At the end of March the caucus divided, according
to Julius Holder, into three groups: thirty-two protectionists, forty-two free

traders, and about twenty-eight who hoped for some kind of compromise.
"This is truly a chess game. The question is who will force the others out.
Bennigsen must soon decide."28 By early May Bennigsen estimated that the
middle group had grown to fifty-two, while twenty-eight still clung to protectionism and twenty-two to free trade. For Bennigsen to have sought harmony
through the expulsion of either group would have been out of character. As
usual his aim was to avoid political suicide for the party by finding some basis
for agreement with Bismarck that the majority at least could accept. The
compromise he fashioned consisted of a moderately protective general tariff,
finance tariffs sufficient to balance state budgets, increases in the tobacco tax,
later consideration of a beer tax, and devices to preserve the Reichstag's
power over the purse even after liquidation of the state assessments. Through
such arrangements he hoped to hold down the dissidents to no more than
twenty-five deputies, perhaps fewer. If the number were larger, he realized,
the national liberals have nothing to bargain with. Instead of forcing expulsion of the free traders, he negotiated with them, to the neglect—and disgust—of Holder and the protectionists.29
By adjourning the Reichstag for an unusually long Easter vacation (April
3-28, 1879), Forckenbeck hoped to gain time for a free-trade counteroffensive which he, Benda, Rickert, Bamberger, and Lasker had plotted on New
Year's Eve.3° Because of his status as an aristocrat (third generation), president of the Reichstag, once president of the Prussian Chamber of Deputies,
lord mayor earlier of Breslau and now of Berlin, Forckenbeck had long been
regarded as the best candidate for leadership in any attempt to reunite the
liberal movement. In the past, he had avoided the kind of parliamentary duels
that had made Lasker both famous and notorious and had carefully nurtured
a good relationship with both the Kaiser and crown prince. Yet in late 1875,
when Lasker and others had wanted to seek "emancipation from Bismarck"
and to "develop the constitution,"31 he had demurred. Now three years later,
under circumstances far less advantageous, he finally tried to seize the initiative. He would "rather sink" than "swim with a reactionary current," he told
Stauffenberg.32
In January Forckenbeck had considered his position at the head of Berlin's
city government a handicap for such an action, but now he exploited it. At
his instigation the Berlin City Council petitioned the Reichstag (April 6) to
reject tariffs on foodstuffs that would lower the living standard of urban dwellj8

ers; twenty-three coastal cities joined the protest. Seventy-two cities responded to his call for a "general convention of German cities." But by the
time their 117 delegates assembled in Berlin (May 17), the cause was already
lost. Few delegates came from the western and southern cities, where protectionism flourished, and even Breslau resisted the invitation of its former
mayor. At a banquet in the Zoological Garden, nevertheless, Forckenbeck
astonished 150 guests (including many left-liberal deputies) with his oratory.
The time had come, he declared after many toasts, for "the German burgher
class" to throw its weight into the scales, to develop "a great liberal party"
that would defend the interests of all classes (Stdnde), both urban and rural.
But the "anti-corn law league" which Forckenbeck, Lowe, Richter, and others envisioned in the alcoholic ambience at the Zoo was stillborn and for good
reason. That great, monolithic German middle class (Burgertum), inspired by
the classical ideals of economic and political freedom, waiting to be summoned to "energetic action" in behalf of a common program, simply did not
exist. Like the "collective will of the nation" and the "genuine German national sentiment," of which Forckenbeck also orated, it was a myth upon
which liberal politicians, writers, and professors had fed for decades. Three
days later a sobered Forckenbeck, hopelessly compromised, resigned the presidency of the Reichstag. Stauffenberg followed by resigning the vice-presidency.33 The protective tariff had produced its first sacrifices.
The Center Party Reacts
That Bismarck was not dependent upon the National Liberal party as a whole
to secure passage of his protectionist program had been evident since October
1878, when eighty-seven centrists signed the protectionist declaration of the
Free Economic Association of the Reichstag. Centrist programs had never
committed the party to economic liberalism, and centrist deputies represented regions of the country (south and west) where protectionist sentiment
ran high among both farmers and businessmen. But obviously the Center
party expected to exact a price for its support of the government's tariff program. Despite the pope's condemnation of Hodel's deed, the party had collaborated in some electoral districts (for example, Mainz and Essen) with social
democrats in the July election,34 and it had voted against the antisocialist

statute in 1878. During the winter session of the Prussian Landtag Ludwig
Windthorst, knowing that there was no chance of success, attempted to save
the remaining Catholic teaching orders from the dissolution scheduled under
the May laws and sought reinstatement of paragraphs 15, 16, and 18 in the
Prussian constitution. In January 1879 the Center picked up some support
from ultraconservatives by denouncing Falk's secularization of the schools as
responsible for the increasing moral degeneration of society.35 In reply to
these assaults, FaIk yielded not an inch of the government's position on the
Kulturkampf, with the warm approval of Bismarck and the Kaiser.36 As long
as FaIk remained in office and the Kulturkampf appeared unabated, liberals
could assume they were still necessary to Bismarck at least on this front, de­
spite the signs of his disaffection on others. Evidently for this reason Bennigsen presumed that he still had some leverage on Bismarck.
FaIk, however, was already in jeopardy. For months during 1878 he had
been at odds with Wilhelm over Protestant church affairs. The Kaiser was
deeply disturbed over the dominance that liberal churchmen (the "falsifiers
of our doctrines") had achieved in the governance of the Evangelical church.
In May the minister tendered his resignation rather than accept two reaction­
ary court preachers whom the king wished to see appointed to the church's
highest body (Oberkirchenrat). During Wilhelm's incapacitation the matter
remained in abeyance. In December, when it had to be faced, Bismarck finally
persuaded FaIk to yield to the old monarch's whim on the grounds that the
issue was secondary compared to the Kulturkampf.37 Throughout 1878 Bis­
marck sought repeatedly to reassure FaIk of his own constancy in the Kultur­
kampf. After talks with Masella in August, he summoned the minister to Bad
Kissingen to report that no settlement, certainly no surrender was in prospect.
Similarly he kept FaIk informed during the following months about his re­
sponses to the continued overtures of Leo XIII and the new Vatican state
secretary, Cardinal Nina. 3 8 These messages came through many channels
and, to the alarm of both FaIk and Bismarck, had some effect at court. The
pope was eager to ease old tensions with governments everywhere in Europe
and, since his efforts were widely reported in the press, both the Kaiser and
crown prince feared that Prussia, by not responding, would gain an image of
unreasoning intransigence.39

Bismarck reacted to these overtures with restraint, his responses dilatory.
He was not convinced that the Vatican had much to offer in return for the

concessions it hoped to exact, and he was no longer so sure that the Vatican
could control the conduct of the Center. 41 But at the same time he antici­
pated that the continuing exchange of notes between the Vatican and Ber­
lin and the stories about improved relations that appeared in the newspa­
pers would produce an uncertainty in the minds of centrists and liberals that
would make them more tractable in their relationships with the government.
Both had to face the prospect that an agreement between Berlin and the Vat­
ican might undercut the position they had taken in the Kulturkampf.42 Al­
though his distrust continued, Bismarck had now come to accept the Center
as a permanent, perhaps necessary, part of the political scene. Its dissolution,
he wrote King Ludwig of Bavaria in February 1879, would contribute little to
the strength of the government, for most of its fragments would merely grav­
itate into other camps.43 To return to an earlier metaphor, Bismarck had de­
cided to open up the entire chessboard for his coming gambits in domestic
politics.
Two days after his return to Berlin on February 5, 1879, Bismarck was
"pleasantly surprised" to receive through Lucius an overture from Windthorst, who spoke of giving precedence to political over religious considera­
tions and of his Guelph loyalty as a sentiment that did not influence his atti­
tude on the tariff issue.44 Shortly afterward, Bismarck granted an interview to
Baron Georg von und zu Franckenstein, a prominent Bavarian and centrist
leader. Denying that he was a "Kulturkampfer by passion," Bismarck blamed
the outbreak of the struggle on the confessional nature of the Center and
especially on the need "to save the German language and to spread German
sentiment [Gesinnung]" in Posen and Upper Silesia. Claiming that he was not
a centralist, he spoke of Prussia as being too large and powerful in Germany;
several large states would be preferable. Germany and Austria united, perhaps
through a constitutional relationship, but not a customs union, would be the
best guarantee of European peace. While he could not yield to the Vatican's
demands for abolition of the May laws and reinstatement of the excised para­
graphs in the constitution, he was "no friend of civil marriage" and had signed
the bill only because Roon, Camphausen, and FaIk threatened to resign.45
On March 31, 1879, the chancellor, during an hour-long private talk with
Windthorst, speeded the rapprochement by granting an annual pension to

the widowed Queen Marie of Hanover. In discussing a possible settlement of
the Kulturkampf, he offered to resume diplomatic relations with the Vatican
if the pope would grant the Anzeigepflkht, that is, the church's duty to notify
the state of nominations for and appointments to ecclesiastical offices and the
state's right to veto the same. Windthorst had to reply (probably with some
bitterness) that he was uninformed concerning the talks going on between
Rome and Berlin. But he doubted that the papacy would ever yield the veto
power to the state. Whether the chancellor brought up the subject of the tariff
bill is doubtful.46 He had no need to buy votes from centrists with major concessions in the Kulturkampf, since they had already declared for protectionism. On the eve of the tariff debate (May 2), the Reichstag caucus confirmed
its decision to vote for protective tariffs, but also announced its intention to
keep a "free hand" where finance tariffs and the tobacco tax were concerned.
The centrists' purpose was to preserve the state assessments as a bulwark of
federalism.47 On the following evening Windthorst created a sensation by
appearing at Bismarck's soiree for the first time since 1869. Formally dressed
in tails, a medal gleaming on his chest, the half-blind little man was warmly
received by his host who guided him to a seat where they talked at length,
while the deputies gaped. Nor did the deputy from Meppen react when his
host accidentally drenched him with beer, bringing a distressed Johanna to
his rescue with a napkin. Afterward, a grinning Windthorst warded off all
questions about what transpired in the conversation with the comment: "Extra centrum nulla solus."48
As the great tariff debate began, Bismarck's chances of success and the
options he would face were already taking shape. Protectionism for industry
appeared to be assured, that for agriculture less certain, at least not at the
higher rates Bismarck desired. By linking industrial to agrarian protectionism,
however, he had made both difficult to oppose. The finance tariffs and new
taxes, however, were another matter. Here he still faced the obstacle that had
ruined von der Heydt in 1868—the reluctance of a goodly segment of the
Reichstag, albeit for differing reasons, to surrender the power unexpectedly
gained from the annual state assessments. But now at least Bismarck had options. He could either come to terms with the national liberals by granting
new guarantees for the Reichstag's power over the purse or settle with the

Center by preserving the state assessments. The first course meant the establishment of new, the latter the preservation of old law.

Passage of the Tariff Act
The Reichstag deliberations on the tariff bills lasted more than two months
(May 2—July 15, 1879). They were marked by lengthy and often stormy debates, agitated discussions in the tariff committee, unprecedented lobbying by
the affected interests, competitive logrolling among the deputies, heated

party caucuses, and many private negotiations between Bismarck and party
leaders, particularly with Bennigsen and Windthorst. The press followed the
affair with impassioned concern. Assemblies and mass meetings were frequent; petitions poured into Berlin from many quarters. The chancellor, who
in recent years had often appeared to be on the verge of physical collapse and
forced retirement, was the eye of the storm, the center around which swirled
the winds of special interests and the debris of shattered ideals and threatened
careers. Never, not even in i866-i867and 1870-1871, had he shown greater
energy and skill in the manipulation of German public opinion. Again he
demonstrated, in the words of a liberal, that he was "one of the greatest rulers
of the masses in our time."49
On May 2 Bismarck launched the first reading of the tariff bill by summarizing the points he had made publicly and privately during preceding months.
His primary case was again fiscal—the need to "consolidate the Reich" by
establishing its financial independence, to solve the financial crisis by raising
new money, and to reduce the burden of direct taxation on real estate and
income. On the protectionist issue he stressed that Germany had become the
dumping ground for the surplus products of other countries (France, Russia,
America), which were raising tariff walls against German goods. The products
he talked about most were those dearest to his heart and purse—grain and
timber. In denouncing direct taxation he waxed most eloquent in describing
the fate of the farmer: "No industry in the entire country is taxed so high as
agriculture." "The work and production of the Fatherland" had to be protected against those abroad (particularly Russians) who "prospered from German gold." The issue should be above politics and factionalism, for it concerned the "welfare of the German people."50 Bennigsen recognized that the
speech, aimed primarily at gentry landlords and their wavering representatives, was a "demagogic masterpiece."51
In the debates and literature of the period the protectionist case was presented in nationalistic as well as materialistic terms. At Easter the semiofficial
Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, for example, wrote of the need for "economic armament." Germans, it declared, had spent their "precious blood" to
expel foreigners and "regain" their national unity. "Henceforth, the new German state will no longer be sacrificed economically any more than politically

to a foreign domination that, among other things, has increasingly impoverished the German Reich from year to year in commerce, agriculture, and
industry and subjected it to the danger of losing in another way the political
independence so dearly purchased."52 To a country whose national unity, so
recently gained, was still a self-conscious and insecure possession, whose social order was threatened by economic catastrophe and socialist subversion,
and whose population had witnessed a series of menacing international crises
during 1875—1878, the invasion of foreign merchandise seemed as real a
threat as the invasion of foreign troops. The "protection of national labor"
became the favorite battle cry of the protectionist horde and of Bismarck, now
its commander-in-chief.53 Protectionism assumed the character of a patriotic
cause rather than of favoritism to special interests.
In the Reichstag debates Bismarck's arguments were buttressed by a steady
succession of protectionist speakers, not only from the government itself
(Hofmann, Tiedemann, Burchard), but also from the affected interests: WiIhelm von Kardorff, owner of Silesian noble estates, an industrialist involved
in many enterprises (iron, banking, railways), and a founder of the Free Conservative party and of the Central Federation of German Industrialists; Karl
Stumm, iron and coal magnate ("King Stumm" of the Saar basin), active in
local and national associations of industrialists; Baron von Varnbuler, once a
Viennese industrialist, former minister-president of Wurttemberg, and owner
of Swabian latifundia; August Rentzsch, secretary-general of the Association
of German Iron and Steel Industrialists; Wilhelm Lowe, physician and former
progressive, brother-in-law of Louis Baare, general director of the Bochumer
Verein, one of the largest iron and coal cartels in the Ruhr; Louis Berger, south
German (Horchheim) factory owner; Friedrich Hammacher, Ruhr mine
owner, involved in railways and banking, a founder and chairman of the Association for Mining Interests at Dortmund; Robert von Ludwig, Baron Julius
von Mirbach-Sorquitten, Baron Wilhelm von Minnegerode, Count Udo zu
Stolberg-Wernigerode—all owners of noble estates in eastern Prussia and Silesia; and, incongruously, Alexander Mosle, a Bremen merchant, who voted
for "German national pride" against the "semitic spirit" of laissez-faire and
internationalism.54

of the 1870s, and the growth of national chauvinism.

The defense of free trade was mostly in the hands of career state officials
(Rudolf Delbriick, Eduard Lasker), journalists and publishers (Eugen Richter,
Heinrich Rickert, Leopold Sonnemann), a professor and scientist (Rudolf
Virchow), a big-city mayor (Max von Forckenbeck), and a lawyer-publicist
(Karl Braun). There were a few notable exceptions: Ludwig Bamberger, radical emigre of 1848, banker in Rotterdam and Paris until his repatriation in
1866, international journalist and commentator on economic affairs; WiIhelm Oechelhauser, director of the Deutsche KontinentcdOasgeseUschaft in
Dessau; Baron Franz Schenk von Stauffenberg, Franconian estate owner with
a law degree; Kurt von Saucken-Tarputschen, owner of a noble estate in East
Prussia and one of the diminishing group of Junkers who had formed the original core of the Progressive party. They represented those liberals who, unshaken by the depression of the 1870s, remained committed to the principle
of laissez-faire as the necessary complement to political liberalism or who represented export industries, commercial centers (especially maritime cities),
and big cities whose welfare depended more on the exchange than upon the
production of goods and on low food prices for the urban masses.55
Between these extremes of fully committed protectionists and free traders
stood the middle groups of conservatives and national liberals. The former
were not fully convinced that protectionism would benefit agriculture and
were alarmed over its effect on the transit trade in grain in eastern Prussia.
The latter favored protection for heavy industry, but not for agriculture,
feared the consequences of the new revenues for the budgetary powers of parliament, and desperately hoped that Bennigsen's maneuverings in the chancellery and Reichstag would produce a way out of the morass that would rescue the powers of parliament and keep the party, at least its majority, together
and intact with the government.
At the outset of the Reichstag debates the advocates of free trade were
aware that the protectionist flood could not be diked.56 Operating from a
strong base in the Center, Conservative, and Free Conservative parties, the
protectionists were obviously in full control of the chamber. On May 9 they
outvoted the free traders by referring the tariff bill to a committee dominated
by protectionists.57 Another crucial test of strength came on May 16 when,
during the second reading of the bill, the chamber rejected (192 to 125) a
motion to reduce the proposed tariff on iron, which then passed in its original
form by an overwhelming majority of 218 to 88. In the minority were the
progressives, a few conservatives, about half of the national liberals, the social
democrats, Guelphs, and Poles.58

Certainty of defeat did not deter the Manchesterites from presenting the
case against protectionism at length, if only for the benefit of voters in the
next election. The leadoff speaker was Delbriick, who, much to Bismarck's
contempt, limited himself to criticizing the technical inadequacies of the bill
drafted by his former colleagues. Others dealt with the big issues, mixing tactical arguments with genuine concern over the social and political consequences of high tariffs. A brief summary of their views will suffice. Being interventionist, the tariff program was socialistic; Germany, the land of the
middle, could not become a "closed commercial state" such as Fichte had
envisioned. The financial difficulties of industry and agriculture were of their
own making. It was an illusion to believe that every segment of society would
benefit from duties intended to protect big industry and big agriculture, an
"unnatural alliance." To substitute indirect for direct taxes was to shift the
fiscal burden from the upper to the lower classes, stimulating class conflict and
socialist agitation. Urban dwellers in general, particularly the low income
groups, would suffer from the increased cost of food and other necessities.
Handicraft workers and home industries would be injured by the higher cost
of imported raw materials and semimanufactured items. Grain tariffs would
not benefit the small farmer specializing in vegetables, potatoes, and dairy
products, nor would timber tariffs benefit the forester and woodcutter. Agrarian tariffs were an "apple of discord" tossed into the assembly and country.
The demand for protectionism had arisen among the industrialists who took
it to Bismarck, who in turn had insinuated it into agrarian circles. That landowners and farmers had not spontaneously called for protection showed that
it was alien to their interests.59 To Richter, Bismarck was a "magician" who
pulled everything imaginable out of his hat (not the least of which was a
commitment to raise the salaries of government employees). The chancellor,
he charged, was concerned with power, not tariffs. "For money is power, and
with money the question of power is decided." Without economic freedom
there could be no political freedom and vice versa.60
Again the discussion was marred by a bitter exchange between Lasker and
Bismarck. In attacking the grain tariff, Lasker disputed the prince's claim that
estate owners were more highly taxed than the rest of the population, charging him with ignorance of pertinent Prussian statutes. The plan to abolish
direct taxes he castigated as the "fiscal politics of property." Even his friends
deplored Lasker's tone, but Bismarck was more than willing to answer in kind.

how, but they are nevertheless clothed." He defended himself against the
charge of "unreliability," a word that Lasker had not used. When Forckenbeck, who presided, tried to interrupt with a light ring of his bell, the chancellor seethed with anger. He denied the right of the chair to call him to
order.61 Lucius feared that Bismarck, by his "irritability and vehemence,"
would destroy the delicate political web that had been spun; it was as though
he deliberately sought to provoke a dissolution and another election, with the
intention of producing an even greater rout of his foes than had the socialist
issue of 1878.62
The free traders failed in their attempt to split the agrarian-industrial front,
despite the misgivings of many landowners over the effect of the iron tariff on
farm implements and of many manufacturers over the effect of the grain tariffs
on the cost of labor. Far from warring against each other, the protectionist
interests joined in ever greater collusion. "Appetite comes with eating," says
the proverb. For not protesting the duty on pig iron (10 marks), the manufacturers of cast iron products received compensation in the form of higher duties
on their own wares. This included agricultural implements, but the agrarians
accepted it; in return, they were permitted to double the proposed duty on rye
from 5 to ro marks. That the latter figure was in accord with Bismarck's wishes
had been publicly known since mid-April, when he had published a letter to
a Bavarian landowner, Baron von Thiingen, expressing his dissatisfaction
with the low rate set in the Bundesrat. OnJuIy 11 a uniform duty of 10 marks
per ton on wheat, rye, oats, and legumes was set by vote of 186 to 160. *3
Having disposed of free trade, Bismarck stalked the wild boar of finance.
What was to be done with the new money provided by the tariff act, an increased tax on tobacco granted in July,6" and an anticipated tax on beer? This
raised again (as in 1868-1869) the thorny issues of the budgetary power of
parliament and of the financial independence of the Reich from the states.
On May 6, 1879, Bennigsen had outlined the possibilities for compromise
with which he hoped to snare both Bismarck and the left-liberals. There
were several ways, he declared, to preserve and even improve the powers
of parliament: "We can choose a number of taxes and tariffs [later those on

Bismarck's push for a government monopoly of the sale of tobacco—one of the issues upon
which the Bennigsen candidature formally shattered—had led in June 1878 to the establishment
of a Committee of Inquiry to gather statistics on tobacco manufacture and trade. GW, VIc, 102;
AWB, I, 275-277. A year later Bismarck ignored the results of this investigation, which were
unfavorable to his purposes, insisting on and getting higher taxes on tobacco—a step toward the
ultimate goal of a monopoly. Bismarck to Hofmann, Jan. 1, 1879. GW, VIc, 130-131.

coffee and salt were chosen] and subject them in the budget to annual renewal; we can select a number of taxes and tariffs and remit them to the
individual states, while leaving the state assessments intact; or we can combine both of these measures in suitable form."65 Three days later Windthorst
outlined the Center's counterproposal: establishment of a definite sum (later
set at 105,000,000 marks in an amendment offered by another centrist leader,
Baron von Franckenstein) to be allocated to the Reich, the surplus to be
shared by the states on the basis of population; extraordinary needs of the
Reich were to be covered by continued state assessments set by the Reichstag.66
Bismarck had two choices, neither of which gave him everything he
wanted. Bennigsen's terms were consistent with what the prince had so often
declared was his primary objective: the financial independence and consolidation of the Reich. Except on the issue of the state assessments, the liberals
had since 1867 been his most consistent supporters of the general cause of
consolidation, in contrast to the Center which had defended particularism in
the guise of federalism. On the issue of the grain tariffs, moreover, the right
wing of the National Liberal party had shown itself amenable. While his aim
was still that of splitting the right wing off "from the Semites" on the left, he
did not wish to drive the moderates "into a corner."67 To do so might weaken
his strategy of alternative choice by forcing them into permanent opposition,
leaving him dependent upon those "ultramontanes, with whom," he still believed "a permanent understanding is completely impossible."68 Whose offer
should he accept?
By contrast to the national liberals, the Center was a solid phalanx which,
under the leadership of Windthorst and Franckenstein, made a considerable
effort to come to terms with the chancellor and the two conservative parties.
At Bismarck's demand the "clausula Franckenstein," as it was to be called,
was amended to increase the Reich's allocation to 130,000,000 marks. Furthermore, the Center abandoned its opposition to high duties on coffee and
petroleum and accepted the bill increasing the tax on tobacco.6» By May 22
the prince had tentatively decided in favor of the Center's proposition, a decision that was hardened one month later when Bennigsen conceded that he
could not deliver enough national liberal votes to produce a majority; thirty
to forty members of the caucus, he reported, would vote against the entire
bill.' 0

After more than a decade of intent and five years of conscious planning and
maneuvering Bismarck gave up his attempt to make the Reich financially independent of the state governments. Not only that, he struck a bargain with
the party he had once denounced as a "mobilization against the state" and
prepared the way for future collaboration with it on other issues. "The best,"
he often said, "is the enemy of the better." Of the options open to him, the
Franckenstein clause was, he decided, less damaging than the budgetary guarantees demanded by the liberals. Teaching the national liberals a lesson,
moreover, would speed the purge of liberal ideologues from their ranks and
make the remaining rump party of moderates more pliable in the future. Driving them into a corner on the tariff issue, he calculated, would not permanently estrange those for whom opposition was normally a discomfort and
embarrassment. Henceforth he could "lean on one crutch or the other or on
both."' 1
On July 9, the chancellor gave to the Reichstag and the nation his version
of the deterioration in his relationship to the National Liberal party. His decision for the Franckenstein clause, he declared, had been reached only after
discovering that the national liberals had chosen a course that he could not
travel—one as destructive to the Reich as socialist subversion. For more than
a year he had been aware that their goodwill had cooled. They wanted "things
I could not grant." They wanted to govern, to increase to a bucketful the
"drop of democratic oil" with which the Kaiser was anointed. In the future
they must conduct themselves with "greater modesty." Only by supporting
the government could they expect to influence it. Instead they had left him
"deserted and isolated," had attacked and vilified him in the press in an "unprecedented and mendacious way." As earlier in the case of the conservatives,
he was compelled to seek his goals by "other routes." Never had Bismarck
made more brutally clear the terms on which he was willing to do business
with the parties of the Reichstag.72
Among the national liberals there was "utter consternation."73 Three resignations from the Prussian cabinet heightened the effect. On June 27 Finance Minister Hobrecht—opposed to protectionism, unwilling to compromise himself further with his liberal colleagues, and painfully conscious of his
own unsuitability for high public office—had resigned, followed on June 30
by Minister of Agriculture Friedenthal and Kultusminister FaIk.74 Obviously
the "liberal era" had ended. Bennigsen and his associates had to decide
whether to join the progressives in opposing not only the Franckenstein
clause, but also, in view of its certain passage, the entire tariff bill. OnJuIy 9,

2ii deputies (conservatives, free conservatives, centrists) voted for, and 122
deputies (national liberals, progressives, Poles, Guelphs, and Social Democrats) against the Franckenstein amendment. The final vote on the entire
statute on July 12 was 217 for and 117 against.75 Voting with the majority
that day were twenty national liberal deputies, of whom fifteen resigned from
the party caucus.7<s It was, Treitschke explained, a "fateful political error" to
be labeled as an "opposition party."77
The Protective Tariff Act of 1879 left a lasting mark on German parliamentary history. We shall see that, while dividing the National Liberal party,
it did not achieve for Bismarck the parliamentary situation he sought—a more
flexible party structure with alternative majorities for the government's program. What it did was to bring together a new combination of interest groups
(heavy industry, big banking, and big agriculture) to buttress the PrussianGerman establishment (Hohenzollern dynasty, Prussian-German bureaucracy, Prussian officer corps, Protestant church, east-Elbian gentry, crowned
heads and high aristocracy of the German lesser states). It constituted another
of those major steps by which that establishment had, since 1806, steadily
accommodated itself to the changing economic and social environment that
we now call "the process of modernization." During Bismarck's years in power
it was probably as important a contribution to that end as was the renewal of
the German Zollverein in 1865 and the capture of the national idea in 18661871.

Yet the cost was considerable, for the general scramble of the interest
groups unleashed by the Bismarck proposal for protectionism stripped away
what remained of the illusion in Germany that politics was a matter of ideals,
of lofty aims based upon universal principles imbedded in the nature of man,
society, and history. As Richter predicted,78 it damaged the image of the "old
Prussian officialdom" famed for its professionalism, selflessness, and dedication to the general interest. A generation bred in the thought and tradition
of German idealism learned again the truth that Hegel had taught, although
his metaphysics had obscured the lesson: namely, that men are moved by their
passions and interests. But they also learned the error of Hegel's assumption
that governments are above the warring interests of civil society. Instead, it
was now apparent that they were closely linked to the economic and social
elites that dominated the struggle. Not even now, more than a century later,
have German historians ceased to lament the loss of innocence suffered in the
rape of 1879.

Negotiation of the Dual Alliance
ONTROLLING ministers and officials was not Bismarck's only problem in late 1879. His greatest struggle was not with them but with the
Kaiser on a critical matter of foreign policy. Within a year Wilhelm
had fully recovered from the shotgun wounds inflicted by Nobiling,
despite his advanced age. Wilhelm's physician believed, so Bismarck asserted,
that the Kaiser had actually benefited, physically and mentally, from "Nobiling's phlebotomy." "The old blood has been drawn off, and he looks much
better now than earlier."1 At any rate the eighty-two-year-old monarch was
sufficiently repaired to give the chancellor the hardest, most difficult contest
of their seventeen-year relationship. For six weeks the Kaiser strove, tooth
and nail, to prevent the negotiation and signing of what has since become
known as the Dual Alliance, the first "permanent" alliance of European international politics. That Bismarck won in the end was owed to the presumption of his indispensability in foreign affairs, shared not only by himself and
his associates but by the Kaiser as well. The struggle was costly, nevertheless,
for it brought the prince after a period of relative health to the verge of nervous and physical collapse.

Tilt toward Austria
Historians have never ceased to search for the beginning point of that fateful
alienation between Germany and Russia that ultimately resulted in the
French-Russian Dual Entente of 1894. The problem is not easy, any more
than is that of the later estrangement between Germany and Britain that
persuaded London to join Paris and Petersburg in the Triple Entente of 1907.2

To determine the time and circumstances of both is to trace the development
of those rival alliances that fought the First World War with such fateful consequences for the future of Germany, Europe, and the world. The answer
seems to be that Germany and Russia parted company gradually over decades
by a series of stages, none of which had to be conclusive. The earliest stages
are undoubtedly to be found in the events of 1875-1879, from the war-insight crisis through the Balkan war and Congress of Berlin to the signing of
the German-Austrian alliance of 1879.
As observed earlier, the war-in-sight crisis need have had no lasting consequences.3 Bismarck's irritation with Gorchakov was purely personal; it was
neither shared by their respective monarchs nor grounded in conflicting interests between their two countries. Gorchakov's age and Bismarck's bad
health seemed to guarantee that both would soon be out of power, replaced
by younger men with other views and aims. That the war-in-sight crisis appears significant for the problem of estrangement is owed entirely to the
chance that the eastern crisis came so close behind it. "I have two powerful
dogs by their collars," Bismarck said of Austria and Russia in the early weeks
of the crisis. "I am holding them apart: first, to keep them from tearing each
other to pieces; second, to keep them from coming to an understanding at our
expense. I believe I am performing a service not only to each of them, but
also to Germany and Europe."4 As the crisis progressed he feared for Germany
the fate of most peacemakers, that of being bitten by one dog or both. If
unable to restrain both, the best course was to tighten the leash on the most
controllable. While Andrassy was in power, that appeared to be Austria.
In May 1875 Andrassy had wisely kept his distance from the British-Russian demarche at Berlin. When he learned of Gorchakov's intention to admonish Bismarck, he is said to have done a handstand on his desk in delight,
exclaiming, "Bismarck will never forgive that!"5 In the fall of 1876 Austria,
as well as Russia, had posed that "indiscreet" question that forced Bismarck
to formulate his options prematurely. The Russian inquiry irritated him but
not the Austrian, because it came first, was without apparent cause, and was
conveyed in a most undiplomatic manner.6 But there was a more fundamental
reason—Bismarck had already begun to think of Austria as the more valued
(Cambridge, Eng., 1982), pp. 63-90; and Judith M. Hughes, Emotion and High Politics: Personal
Relations at the Summit in Late Nineteenth-Century Britain and Germany (Berkeley, 1983).

ally. In explaining to the Kaiser and foreign office his response to Russia, he
wrote that Germany should assist Russia wherever such assistance was consonant with German interests, but not at the cost of a "deep and lasting disturbance in our relationship to that ally of ours that has been until now the
most useful and that may in the future be the most important and, in its inner
circumstances, relatively the most reliable."7 In February 1878, as Austria
faced the possibility of a violent confrontation with Russia, Bismarck again
informed Vienna that Germany would remain neutral in such a war. Yet he
confessed to Karolyi that Germany, although unable to tolerate a Russian
occupation of Moravia, would not take a similarly adverse view of an equivalent Austrian conquest in Russia. In the "later phase" of a war between Russia and Austria, "therefore," Austrian-German relations "might take a turn
for the better."8 When Andrassy proposed on February 28, 1878, at the height
of the crisis with Russia, that Austria and Germany form a defensive alliance
(with which England might associate), Bismarck declined, but more on
grounds of prematurity than preference.9
During 1876-1878 Bismarck began to tilt German foreign policy, ever so
cautiously, toward Austria. Of the many factors influencing that decision—
Austria's strategic geopolitical position in the middle of Europe, her cultural
bonds and earlier political links with Germany, German Austrophilism and
Russophobia, and the contrasting internal pressures on foreign policy in both
countries—the last appears to have been much on his mind at this time. In
these years, the statesmen of both countries were compelled by domestic interests to assume postures in foreign relations they would have preferred to
avoid. Panslav agitation in Russia had forced Gorchakov and Tsar Alexander
into an aggressive action against Turkey, while Austro-German and Hungarian opposition to the incorporation of more Slavs into the empire had kept
Andrassy from annexing Bosnia and Herzegovina outright. To force a pigeon
down the Austrian throat was far easier than to compel the Russians to disgorge one.
Even as he sent the first faint signal to Austria of his intention to be more
protective of Austria's than Russia's position and power in Europe, Bismarck
began to suggest ideas concerning the character of Germany's future relationship to Austria. According to Baron von Miinch's report to Andrassy of his
interview with Bismarck at Varzin in October 1876, the German chancellor
held out the prospect of a future "organic alliance sanctioned by the votes of
the representative assemblies" of the two governments.IO A few months later

he spoke in a similar vein to the Wurttemberg minister Baron von Mittnacht.
"The peaceloving powers in central Europe are dependent upon each other to
ward off disturbances to the peace from the west as well as the east. Germany
can perhaps attain an organic union with Austria, if not in the form of the
empire of seventy millions that was earlier so often discussed."11 Sometime
during T877 Bismarck amplified these hints in a remarkable interview with
Karl Braun that deserves extensive quotation as the fullest statement of what
the prince had in mind at this time. "Austria-Hungary is a unique mosaic of
different races, religions, and peoples." If not firmly joined, the pieces of that
mosaic might strike each other and fall apart. If fixed to a solid wall or floor,
they could not fall into disarray, and, furthermore, changes could be made in
the composition. "In the former case every internal difference leads to a crisis
abroad. But in the latter case domestic issues will find resolution in peace and
quiet without exploding externally."
He told Braun—a Nassau lawyer, journalist, and leading member (national
liberal) of the Reichstag—that the first task was to determine "what we do
not want. We do not wish to reconstitute the German Bundestag [of 18151866]. . . . Nor do we want again, as in the time of the blessed Herr von
Bruck, to chase after the phantom of customs unification. . . . A customs
union is impossible between two states whose monetary, production, and consumption relationships are so different as are those of the German Reich and
the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. . . . Finally, we do not want a merely temporary ad hoc union, perhaps for the purpose of a conquest, as at the time of
the Schleswig-Holstein crisis. Such a union is without lasting interest and
can, as we have seen, suddenly turn upside down at any time. Useful to both
parties would be a lasting organic connection," but not one that would produce "either fusion or confusion," either economic and financial community
or mutual interference in each other's internal affairs. "Instead the connection should exclude in the strictest and most definite way possible all of [these
possibilities] through an agreement that would mutually guarantee the present
possessions of both sides and obligate both to maintain the peace of central
Europe, offensively and defensively, with the help of permanent institutions.
Such a union would not exclude, but rather provide for a series of agreements
for uniform arrangements in the areas of jurisprudence, legislation, and administration—as well as in economic and social-political matters—a cooperation that could undoubtedly be most beneficial for two commonwealths that
are so well suited to complement one another."12

* The Change of Front Completed, 1879-1880 *

Many months before the Congress of Berlin and nearly three years before
he actively promoted the alliance with Austria, Bismarck had already formed
his general conception of that alliance. In Austria's internal difficulties he
saw not only potential dangers for European peace but also possible advantages for German foreign policy. The Habsburg Empire's internal weaknesses
would make it dependent upon Germany and subordinate to Berlin's leadership in foreign affairs. At the time he spoke to Munch, Mittnacht, and Braun
Bismarck was groping for a new economic policy, largely for internal reasons,
but had not yet arrived at protectionism. That Germany was still committed
to free trade and Austria to protectionism presented no barrier to their future
"organic connection," as he conceived it. Nor did his subsequent conversion
to protectionism in 1878-1879 alter his vision of the future political relationship between the two countries, despite the expected adverse effect of the
new tariffs upon Austrian, as well as Russian and American, exports to Germany.I3 Where major decisions were concerned, economic and political interests traveled on separate and not necessarily parallel tracks in Bismarck's
thoughts. Their union was an "ideal goal," but not a realistic necessity.14
forward his own developing views about the economic and political relationship between the two
countries. In what month of 1877 the interview took place is unknown. Clearly, however, Bismarck did not begin in 1879 to think of an "organic union" with Austria as some have believed.
See, for example, William L. Langer, European Alliances and Alignments (2d ed., New York,
1956), p. 174. The idea had an earlier origin.
13
See his remarks to Austro-Hunganan Ambassador Count Emmerich Szechenyi, Jan. 26-29,
1879, at Friedrichsruh. GW, VIII, 293-295. In February 1879 Bismarck told the Bavarian
Reichstag deputy, Baron Georg von und zu Franckenstein, "Even a constitutional relationship
between Austria and Germany is conceivable, but certainly not a common customs." BP, II,
317. There appears to be no substance to the assertions of Helmut Bohme that Bismarck took
seriously the plan for a European customs union proposed to him in Sept. 1878 by a French
economist and editor, G. de Molinari, and that he gave serious attention to a central European
version of the idea in the summer of 1879. See his Deutschfonds Weg zur Grossmocht.- Studien zum
Verhdltnis von Wirtschaft und Stoat wdhrend der Reichsgrundungszeit, 1848-1881 (Cologne, 1966),

The signing of the Dual Alliance did not lead to better commercial relations between Germany and Austria. The treaty of 1868, which left Austria's tariffs high in comparison with Germany's, expired at the end of 1877. Despite extensive negotiations on a new treaty during 1877,
no agreement could be reached. As a stopgap the two powers extended the treaty of 1868 (with
some modifications) annually until 1881, when it lapsed. During the negotiations for the Dual
Alliance Bismarck held out the prospect of major tariff concessions, but afterward they did not
materialize. In the relationship between Austria and Germany, politics clearly took precedence
over economics. Waller, Bismarck at the Crossroads, pp. 197-198, and A. von Matlekovits, Die
Zollpolitik der osterreichisch-ungarischen Monarchic und des deutschen Reiches seit 1868 (Leipzig,

Where economic and political interests did not coincide, the latter took precedence.

The "Two-Chancellors War"
Although the prospect of an alliance with Austria was already evolving in his
mind, Bismarck made no attempt to negotiate with Vienna for more than a
year after the Congress of Berlin. Several considerations may have influenced
this delay: he had not yet fully made up his mind to follow the course he
contemplated; he lacked as yet a provocation adequate to overcome the Kaiser's inevitable resistance to a break with Russia; and he needed time to execute his customary tactic, time in which first to seek an accommodation with
Russia, if only to prove to himself and others its impossibility.
The war scare of 1875 and the Balkan crisis of 1875-1878 had exposed
weaknesses in the relationships Germany had established with Russia and
Austria in 1872-1873. The extended and deepening economic crisis in world
capitalism probably contributed to this alienation by creating a climate of
anxiety whose political effects are often assumed but are difficult to trace. In
January 1877 Moltke, concerned about Russian troop concentrations in Galicia, wrote to Bismarck of his fears that, as the economic crisis worsened,
Russia's "leading circles" would be all the more inclined "to seek a violent
way out of the calamity."15 To what degree this mood actually contributed to
the steam behind the Panslavist movement and the willingness of the government to respond to its pressure is difficult to assess.l6 But certainly the continuing economic crisis exacerbated European international relations in general
by mobilizing protectionist movements with xenophobic tendencies.
Although every major European country except Britain soon yielded to
these pressures, the first severe jolt occurred when Russia, whose Finance
Minister Michael Reutern, hard put to finance the coming war against Turkey, decreed that duties on imported goods be paid henceforth in gold specie

The motivation of Russian foreign policy in the Balkan affair is unlikely to be determined
from purely German archival and secondary sources as in Muller-Link, lndustriahsierung una AussenpoUtik, pp. 19-102, 122. For a broader-based assessment see Geyer, Der russische lmperudismus,
PP- 55-76- Throughout 1876 many Russians in high positions, including the tsar and Minister of
Finance Michael Reutern, dreaded war against Turkey precisely because it would compromise the
country's economy, public finance, and recent reforms. See Wilhelm von Schweinitz, ed., Denkwurdigkeiten des Botschafters General von Schweinitz (Berlin, 1927), I, 317-318, and Serge Goriainov, Le Bosphore et les Dardanelles (Paris, 1910), pp. 321-322.

came effective on the precise day, January i, 1877, when the last protective
duties fell in Germany. Naturally this coincidence was doubly irritating to
German manufacturers, who had hoped that Russia would grant reciprocity
by lowering its barriers against German goods. Although the primary purpose
of the gold decree was fiscal, Reutern was conscious of its protectionist benefits for Russian manufactures.17 While the Russian "gold tariff" accelerated
the demand for German "retaliatory tariffs" and in general reinforced the protectionist movement in Germany, no direct evidence has yet been produced
to show that it had a significant effect upon Bismarck's reconstruction of Germany's foreign relations in 1877-1879.18
Unquestionably economic, social, and nationalistic pressures activated by
the depression did tend to cleave apart the three partners in the Three Emperors League. But those adverse effects were to be seen on the relations between all European powers. The decisions, moreover, on whether to yield to
those pressures and on what constituted the true "interest of state" lay with
the individuals who sat in the seats of power and influence in the palaces and
chancelleries. No one was more aware of this than Bismarck. We have seen
how eager he was during the Balkan crisis to keep the pro-German Andrassy
in power at the Ballhausplatz. His concern over the influences that might
prevail in Vienna if Andrassy should be ousted was one of the factors that led
Bismarck to consider an "organic alliance" with Austria so binding that it
would endure whoever might succeed the Hungarian as chancellor. By the
same token the presence of the doddering Gorchakov at the foreign ministry
in Petersburg meant to Bismarck that Russian foreign policy would be rudderless and hence subject to winds and currents that were difficult to calculate
and likely to be inimical to German interests. For that reason he attempted
in the months that followed the congress to unseat "the childish and senile"19
chancellor and boost Count Peter Shuvalov into the saddle. Shuvalov had
won his spurs in the Russian government as chief of the third section, the
secret police. As ambassador to Britain, he had been a persistent supporter of
Russia's continued participation in the Three Emperors League. Bismarck
hoped that, if elevated to the chancellorship, he would consolidate Russia's
relations with Austria and Germany and put the lid on the steaming pot of
social and political unrest in Russia.20
During the Congress of Berlin Gorchakov took care to distance himself

from Shuvalov's bargaining in order better to deny all responsibility for an
unpopular peace on his return to Petersburg. After the final session he hurried
home, while Shuvalov lingered to enjoy the fleshpots of the German capital.
By the time the ambassador reached Petersburg he found "the rotten old
scoundrel" Gorchakov had "infamously and wickedly slandered" him at the
imperial palace. Alexander, who in 1877 had hesitated to yield to the Panslav
agitation, but then yielded to it, now feared its wrath. But he had also come
to identify with its unreasonable expectations and to fear for the government's
authority if they were unrealized. He raged that the congress had been "a
European coalition against Russia under the leadership of Prince Bismarck"
for Austria's benefit. And yet this often quoted remark was but a momentary
outburst. The tsar was inconsistent in his judgments and usually open to the
opinions of those around him, who did not speak with a single voice.2' In
August 1878 Gorchakov left Russia on a recuperative leave in western Europe
that lasted many months. During his absence Shuvalov's star seemed to ascend.
After the signing of the Treaty of Berlin the chief concern of European
diplomacy was its execution. The most critical decisions had been reached in
so short a time only by leaving the details to be worked out by commissions.
The details were by no means trivial, presenting in some instances the possibility of serious conflicts between the great powers. Bismarck's course was to
support the inclination of Austria and Russia to make common cause in the
commissions against efforts by the Porte, or by its former subjects, to obstruct
the treaty's execution. Where the Austrian position was unclear or unknown,
the German delegates initially supported Russian interests in the commissions. For a few weeks Europe experienced something like a revival of the
Three Emperors League.22 Shuvalov's policy appeared to be triumphant, and
from London Munster reported to Berlin that the ambassador acted almost as
though he were already Russian foreign minister.23
As the Balkan disputes reached what seemed to be a "critical phase" in
mid-October 1878, however, Bismarck became wary. He feared that the collaboration between Germany's two partners might become too close and
might alienate the British, whose trust he had so recently won. Hence he
ordered German representatives to keep a low profile in the deliberations of

way Gorchakov's version of events at the congress. It shows Shuvalov (front and center) energetically shaking hands with Bismarck, as Andrassy looks on, while Gorchakov sits heavily in a
chair at the end of the conference table yards away. See p. 441.

the commissions. They should support Russia and Austria, where those powers were in agreement, but not to the point of conflict with England. Russian
requests for German backing must be referred secretly to Berlin for decision.
German representatives must avoid any active, mediatory role, lest Germany
become a target for those dissatisfied with the outcome. Germany could not
afford to endanger its relations with other powers over issues that did not
affect its interests.24 When Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm urged a more
active role for Germany in suppressing native unrest in Bulgaria, Bismarck
sent him copies of the policy memoranda of 1876-1877 (including the "Kissingen dictation") and explained again that lasting peace in the eastern question was not in Germany's interest for, if "neighboring powers, all of whom
hate us," had their hands free, they would naturally (given Germany's central
geographical position) seek and find common ground against her. Austria
could experience "a change of government and system" that would bring to
power with surprising quickness anti-German, ultramontane elements that
would seek rapprochement and alliance with France.25
Bismarck's "see-saw" tactics in the effort to balance Russia against Britain
and his wish to keep the Balkan conflict from expiring severely limited the
possibility of reviving the Three Emperors League. But it also ran counter to
his simultaneous attempt to elevate Shuvalov to the Russian chancellorship.
Immediately after the congress adjourned in July Bismarck granted an interview to Henry Blowitz, correspondent of the London Times, in which, among
other pleasantries, he is reputed to have said, "But for the affair of 1875, he
[Gorchakov] would not be where he is and would not have undergone the
political defeat he has just experienced." In the German press Bismarck also
spread the word that at the congress the half-senile Russian chancellor had
been a "calamity for Russia and her friends; not even the best intentions of
the latter would suffice to make up for the consequences of his foolishness."
By the time Blowitz's report was published (September 7) Bismarck had grown
more cautious. Publicly he disavowed, privately he admitted its accuracy. In
the following weeks he directed the foreign office press bureau to launch articles in the nongovernmental press lauding Shuvalov's statesmanship; on
September 22 the official Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung carried such an article authored by Bismarck himself.26 In the following months he returned to
the attack both in the press and in dispatches to Schweinitz, whose contents—complaining of Gorchakov's flirtations with France and praising Shuvalov's support of the Three Emperors League—were intended for the Russian
foreign office. In March he took the extraordinary step of sending General
Bernhard von Werder, German military attache at Petersburg, to the tsar with

the warning that German-Russian relations could not improve as long as Gorchakov was in charge of Russian foreign policy.27
Bismarck's tactics against Gorchakov were similar to those he had recently
used to rid himself of Prussian ministers and imperial officials. By these means
he had unhorsed Harry von Arnim in 1874-1875, Delbriick in 1876, and
Camphausen and Achenbach in 1878. Yet those same tactics had failed
against Friedrich Eulenburg and General von Stosch. (Nor did his press vendettas against Empress Augusta and officials of the imperial household achieve
results.) In domestic affairs Bismarck had the advantage that Wilhelm, upon
whose will the careers of ministers and officials depended, had long since
come to look upon the prince as indispensable. But this was hardly true of a
foreign monarch like Alexander II, to whom Bismarck's crude attempt to determine who would be Russian chancellor must have appeared intolerable.
By December 1879 it became evident that Gorchakov had been counted
out prematurely. Stopping at Berlin on the way to Petersburg, the Russian
chancellor appeared somewhat restored—enough at least to launch a counterattack. At a diplomatic reception he openly criticized Austrian policy in
the presence of Karolyi and complained that no European power, Germany
included, had fulfilled its obligations to Russia. In an audience with the Kaiser
he again took credit for preserving peace in 1875.28 Back in the Russian capital, he clung to the office he had held since 1855, and Alexander would not
dismiss him, even though the chancellor obviously could no longer carry out
his duties. Following the Congress of Berlin the Russian press had tended to
blame Austria and England for what was generally regarded as a catastrophic
peace. After Gorchakov's return the current changed, and Bismarck and Germany became the objects of journalistic recrimination—with appropriate responses from Germany. Germany's drift toward protectionism in agriculture
was another irritant.29
In Gorchakov's view Russia had been foully betrayed by her two allies, and,
since France had turned republican, Russia had no recourse but to rely henceforth upon itself alone.30 On February 4, 1879, came the revelation that Austria and Germany had abrogated article 5 of the Treaty of Prague (1866),
which had provided for a plebiscite in northern Schleswig. To the Russians
this "odieux escamotage" proved that the broker at Berlin had not been so

honest after all; secretly he too had exacted his price for humiliating Russia.31
Almost simultaneously the German government overreacted to news of a
plague on the lower Volga by closing the Russian-German border, a measure
so excessive that even Schweinitz thought it motivated more by political "chi­
canery" than medical necessity.32 As anger against Germany mounted in Rus­
sia, Shuvalov's cause declined. In December 1878 he had already begun to
consider resignation, and in May 1879 he took an indefinite leave, from
which he never returned to active service. The coup de grace that Bismarck
aimed at Gorchakov felled Shuvalov instead.
What led Bismarck to commit what seems to have been an egregious error
in judgment? To assume that personal malice was primary in the action
against Gorchakov is to misunderstand Bismarck's modus operandi. 33 As has
been repeatedly shown, his tactical instinct required that, before launching a
major change in policy, he test the viability of the alternative course. To that
end, for example, he had recently sought to bind the National Liberal party
to the government before delivering the blows that weakened it at the polls
and ultimately divided it. Before seeking the "organic alliance" with Austria,
he had to ascertain whether the life of the Three Emperors League might be
extended by securing the appointment as Russian chancellor of a person sym­
pathetic to its perpetuation. If not, a more drastic route had to be taken: a
closer union between Germany and Austria that would guarantee Germany
against isolation in Europe and hopefully assure that Russia, to avoid isola­
tion, would come to terms with Berlin and Vienna, whoever was Russian
chancellor.

Alexander's Blunder, Bismarck's Opportunity
As shown, Bismarck returned to Berlin in February 1879 in generally good
physical and nervous condition, buoyed no doubt by political progress in do­
mestic affairs and the prospect of success in getting the tariff bill through
31
DDF, II, 437-439. A secret treaty abrogating Article 5 of the Treaty of Prague had been
signed on Apr. 13, 1878, but was now postdated to Oct. 11, 1878, in the hope of avoiding the
"malicious" charge that Austria had "bought" German support against Russia. The treaty of Apr.
13 came about because Austria was eager to be rid of an obligation in which it had no further
interest, while Bismarck wanted to be rid of a neuralgic point in German foreign relations. In
seeking its publication, Bismarck expected to undercut Guelph agitation for execution of the
plebiscite that arose on the occasion of the betrothal of Princess Thyra of Denmark to the Duke
of Cumberland (pretender to the throne of Hanover after the death of his father, the exiled King
Georg V, on June 12, 1878). Bismarck had offered to support the duke's claim to the duchy of
Brunswick and to restore the Guelph Fund, if he would renounce the Hanoverian crown, recog­
nize the German Reich, and signify his submission by visiting Berlin. The duke refused. See

Reichstag and Bundesrat. Hence it is not surprising to find him contemplating
again the plan for alliance with Austria, first mentioned in late 1876 but dormant now for more than two years. Even as he carried out the action against
Gorchakov, he began to prepare the contrary option. Because Russia could
no longer be relied on, he told Schweinitz in April 1879, Germany could not
antagonize the other powers, particularly England and Austria. "On the contrary, we must strive for a closer understanding with Austria that will lead to
an organic relationship that cannot be dissolved without approval by the parliamentary bodies [of both countries]." The reasons Bismarck gave for this
change in strategy were: Gorchakov's "continuing coquetry" with France; the
"endless" military expansionism of Minister of War Count Dmitry Milyutin;
the stationing of avant-garde cavalry units on the German border; and the
unbridled language of the Moscow and Petersburg presses.34 But his most important motive has to be sought not in the danger of Russian aggression—
which he certainly exaggerated—but in the dynamics of European power politics. The virtual collapse of the Three Emperors League had left not only
Russia but also Austria free to seek other allies. That Austria too might eventually escape the German orbit was not inconceivable. If Germany was to be
one of three in an unstable system of five great powers, it must have at least
one firm ally; history and geography made Austria the best candidate. Such a
powerful combination could be a magnet with which to attract at least one
additional partner, perhaps even two. The identity of British and Austrian
interests, shown by their recent collaboration at the Congress of Berlin, made
Britain the logical third partner.
But such a triple alliance would leave open the possibility that the two
excluded powers, Russia and France, would turn to each other for support—a
combination that Bismarck had feared since the 1850s. To be sure, the support given Russia by France in the Balkan imbroglio had not measured up to
Gorchakov's expectations, and the conquest by republicans of the French
cabinet and presidency (May 1877 to January 1879) had widened still further
the gap between Paris and Petersburg.35 If shut out by a British-AustrianGerman combination, the excluded powers were, nevertheless, likely to court
each other. No more than in the days of the Three Emperors League, however, was Bismarck willing to abandon the fourth power to the embrace of the
fifth. To be one of three was good, but one of four was better. Following the
defeat of the monarchist factions in France, Bismarck assiduously cultivated
better relations with successive republican cabinets.36
Bismarck would probably have initiated diplomatic steps toward the new

relationship with Austria in early 1879 but for the opposition of the Kaiser.
To Wilhelm the developing rift with Russia was agonizing; he had no desire
to widen it by entering a far-reaching agreement with Austria. Throughout
his long life the relationship with Russia, reinforced by kinship ties between
Romanov and Hohenzollem, had been the firmest and most enduring pillar
of Prussian and German foreign policy. In view of Wilhelm's attachment to
this "sacred legacy," Bismarck's plan lay dormant until August 1879, when
the Russians themselves forced the issue. They complained to the German
foreign office that German delegates on the commissions established to implement the Treaty of Berlin were voting consistently with Austria against
Russia. From Kissingen Bismarck ordered his subordinates to respond that
assisting Russia had proven to be for Germany a thankless task; as a consequence Berlin must nurture her relationships with other powers.37 There followed one of those bitter skirmishes in the newspapers of both countries that
had become all too familiar.38
Now Alexander II committed a blunder that Bismarck was quick to exploit.
Since the Balkan war the tsar had become increasingly irritated by what he
believed to be Germany's failure to reciprocate Russia's benevolent neutrality
during the wars of 1866 and 1870-1871. On August 6-7, 1879, he told
Schweinitz bluntly that Germany must change its conduct, if it wished to
continue its long-standing relationship with Russia. Otherwise "this will end
in a very serious way."39 Soon afterward, the tsar dispatched a personal letter
to his uncle, the Kaiser, sharply rebuking Bismarck's hostile policy toward
Russia, which he attributed to the chancellor's personal quarrel with Gorchakov. "The consequences may be disastrous for our two countries." Bismarck
attributed Alexander's threatening attitude to the influence of Milyutin (Gorchakov was on vacation), whom he accused of hating all Germans, but also
to Alexander's "obvious" desire to fortify his shaky internal position "through
warlike action abroad." He counselled a firm, unyielding response, but Wilhelm insisted on a moderate and even reassuring one.4°
Schweinitz's report on Alexander's remarks arrived in Berlin shortly before
news from Vienna of the impending resignation of Andrassy as chancellor of
the Dual Monarchy. Although Andrassy had been ill, Bismarck suspected
that the Hungarian was actually being forced out of office by those (including
the Archduke Albrecht) opposed to his pro-German and anti-Russian course
in foreign affairs. Another disturbing event in Austria was the appointment
as Austrian prime minister of Count Eduard Taaffe, who believed in the necessity of appeasing the Czechs and other Slavic minorities, a policy which,

503

if extended to foreign affairs, logically meant rapprochement with Russia.41
On August 13, Bismarck asked Andrassy for a meeting, a request that became
all the more urgent following receipt a few days later of the tsar's letter to the
Kaiser. Again Bismarck was troubled by the vision of a resurrected "Kaunitz
coalition"—the combination of great powers that had nearly defeated Frederick the Great.42 Or did he feign such a nightmare in order to justify a course
he had already decided to take? At any rate the two chancellors met at Bad
Gastein, August 27-28, 1879. At this conference Andrassy, who had long
advocated a coalition with Germany, agreed to remain in office long enough
to conclude a "defensive alliance" to ward off "any attack by Russia either
alone or in concert with other powers against either of the German powers."
Kaiser Franz Joseph readily accepted the concept, for he and Andrassy were
of one mind on the necessary course. But Kaiser Wilhelm was shocked; such
alliances, he declared, were "contrary to his principles."43
On August 31, Bismarck dispatched from Gastein the first in a series of
memoranda to the Kaiser, explaining why an alliance with Austria was justified in the light of the European situation and the relationships of the great
powers. He began by denouncing Gorchakov's persistent flirtations with Germany's enemies. Alexander's recent threats showed that Germany had lost its
last remaining friend in the Russian capital. In autocratic Russia the tsar could
send the army poised on the Vistula over the German border merely by signing an order, no explanations required. Germany could not depend any more
on the goodwill of the tsar to ward off such a disaster, but only on a defensive
alliance with Austria, for which he had striven since 1866. Russia could
hardly object to the resurrection of an old defensive alliance, to which Russia
itself had had close ties after the Congress of Vienna and which had served
for half a century as the bulwark of peace in Europe. On the contrary, it would
be tempted to become again the third partner in the coalition. Without the
certainty of Germany's support against an incalculable Russia, moreover,
Austria might seek it in France. If allied to Germany, on the other hand,
Austria would find support in Britain. A triple alliance between Germany,
Austria, and Britain would be powerful enough to restrain Russia from an
attack on either of the central European great powers and prevent France from
allying with Russia.44

* The Change of Front Completed, 1879-1880 *

By the time Bismarck's plaidoyer reached Berlin (September 2), Alexander
had grasped his error and begun the attempt to rectify it. He invited Wilhelm
by telegraph to join him at Alexandrovo in Russian Poland, where the Russian army was engaged in routine military maneuvers. From Gastein Bismarck
vainly advised against the visit. But the Kaiser was determined to see for himself whether things had gone "as far" with the tsar as they seemed to have.45
At Alexandrovo on September 3-4, Alexander denied that his letter of August 15, which he alone had written, was intended as a threat. He had merely
wanted to warn of the harmful effects of Germany's anti-Russian votes on the
Balkan commissions and the newspaper skirmish that followed. Wilhelm,
who was fond of his nephew, wanted to be reassured, and was. Before leaving
Alexandrovo he even conferred a high decoration on Milyutin, well known
for his anti-German views. To ally with Austria against Russia, Wilhelm
wrote to Bismarck, would be a dishonorable act that he would never commit;
instead he would prefer to abdicate. He forbade Bismarck to visit Andrassy in
Vienna. But then, after receiving the chancellor's remonstrance, he reversed
himself, insisting only that Russia must not be mentioned in the treaty as a
potential foe.46 Not even on this point was he to get his way.
In his memoirs Bismarck expressed his gratification that in 1879 an AustroGerman alliance was popular with almost all factions in German public life,
including conservatives, national liberals, and Catholics. On his journey
across Austria to Vienna he was applauded by excited thousands at the railway
stations, embarrassingly so at Linz where he closed the curtains of his railway
car, lest Austrian authorities should think he was deliberately fostering public
favor. In Vienna his progress from the railway station to his hotel aroused
demonstrations in the streets so continuous that he had to tip his hat the
entire way. Today, he meditated, it was scarcely possible for a "great government" to commit its strength to support a friendly power, if that commitment
were not backed by the people. But at the same time, he averred that the
reasons for allying with Austria were so compelling that he would have concluded the alliance even without popular support.47
At Vienna on September 23-24 Bismarck was compelled to accept most of
Andrassy's terms. The Hungarian rejected the far-reaching plan for an "organic union" ratified by the parliaments of both countries. For it he substituted a secret treaty lasting five years. But he also insisted on a declaration
that, if either power was attacked by Russia, the other would come to the aid
of the attacked with all its forces. If either were attacked by any power other
than Russia, its ally would maintain benevolent neutrality, unless Russia supported the attacker, in which case the casus foederis would apply. Austria, in

other words, would not commit itself to fight with Germany against France
for the defense of Alsace-Lorraine unless Russia joined France in the attack.
When he saw that Andrassy was adamant on this point, Bismarck feigned an
ultimatum. Rising suddenly from his chair, he leaned close to the Hungarian
and said menacingly, "Either accept my proposal or else . . ." Andrassy remained silent, and Bismarck finished the sentence with a laugh, "Otherwise
I will have to accept yours."48
We are well informed about the dispute between chancellor and Kaiser because it occurred at long distance. While Bismarck was at Gastein and Vienna, Wilhelm was in Berlin, Alexandrovo, and East Prussia. By the time the
chancellor reached Berlin, the Kaiser was at Baden-Baden. The separation
complicated the debate, but it also enabled Bismarck to marshal his arguments in long dictations, which Wilhelm, being unable to interrupt, would
have to read to the end.49 "As models of political writing, and as specimens
of close and cogent reasoning these reports and memoranda," wrote William
L. Langer, "are without equals in the literature of modern diplomacy."50 They
are also fine examples of Bismarck's talent for persuasion, the capacity to orient his discourse—without obvious injustice to the facts—to fit the thoughts,

prejudices, and predilections of the recipient. Wilhelm's counterarguments
were also lengthy and skillful for a person his age. The treaty, he declared,
was aimed at Russia, and that was both unnecessary and a "perfidious" betrayal of a long friendship. While Germany promised assistance to Austria
against a Russian assault, Austria was not similarly obligated to help Germany
against France. Hence the obligations were unequal. France was the real foe,
not Russia, which should be invited to rejoin Austria and Germany in a revived Three Emperors League.51
Bismarck could not dent Wilhelm's confidence in the reliability of Russian
foreign policy and the identity of German and Russian interests. Hence he
enlisted the support of Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm, General Moltke,
Prince Hohenlohe (German ambassador to France), ministers of the lesser
states, and at the critical moment the entire Prussian cabinet. The final threat
that enabled him to align these forces behind his cause was that of resignation. If compelled to follow a foreign policy contrary to his judgment and
conscience, he would decline the responsibility and depart—along with the
entire cabinet.52 Since the Congress of Berlin at least, no one was inclined
any longer to dispute Bismarck's mastery of foreign affairs. In the end this was
true also of the Kaiser, who on October 4 bowed to the prince's ultimatum.
"Bismarck," he sighed, "is more necessary than I am." Two days later the
treaty was signed in Vienna and on October 17 ratifications were exchanged.53
An Option for Austria?
Did Bismarck exercise an option for Austria over Russia in 1879? The question of Bismarck's intentions is important, for, to many historians, the Dual
Alliance of that year was the first stone in the construction of that fatal system
of conflicting alliances whose rivalry produced the First World War.54 Undoubtedly he did establish Austria as the closer ally, the partner with whom
Germany was henceforth to be the most firmly associated. But the Bismarck

system called for two allies, not one. Hence the critical question is the identity of the third partner. In the dispute with Wilhelm during August and September Bismarck maintained that a defensive alliance with Austria, even one
specifically aimed at Russia, did not preclude good relations with the tsarist
regime. Wilhelm suspected and Bismarck denied that the purpose was to isolate Russia by building a coalition between Germany, Austria, Britain, and
even France.
Both assumptions were correct. In Bismarck's calculations everything depended upon the dynamics of Russian policy. If Russia continued to demand
of Germany actions incompatible with German interests, Bismarck would use
the connection with Austria as a bridge to Britain. The three powers would
share the objective of frustrating Russian aggression. The conciliatory course
of the Waddington government toward Germany left open the possibility that
even France might be attached to the combination. If, on the other hand,
fear of isolation and revolution should moderate Russian policy toward Germany and Austria, Bismarck was not averse to the idea of reconstituting the
Three Emperors League, but only as a supplement to, not a replacement for,
the Dual Alliance.55
These calculations explain actions Bismarck took in late 1879 that have
puzzled historians. On September 14—ten days after Wilhelm's visit at Alexandrovo and seven days before Bismarck's trip to Vienna—the chancellor
dispatched to Count Miinster, German ambassador in London, copies of the
critical documents recording the tsar's "direct threats and far-reaching demands" (without reference to subsequent denials) and directing the ambassador to inquire of Disraeli what the British attitude would be if Germany,
"out of friendship with Austria and England," came into conflict with Russia
by rejecting demands that did not directly affect German interests.56 To execute his instructions, Miinster, who was on vacation in Germany, had to go
to London, where he found no ministers present. On finally reaching Disraeli
at Hughenden on September 26, Miinster, a pronounced Anglophile, engaged in an extensive and wide-ranging discussion that may have exceeded
his instructions. According to Disraeli's account, the German ambassador declared that Russia was preparing to attack Austria and that Germany, to preserve the peace, wished an "alliance between Germany, Austria, and Great
Britain."
Miinster sent to Berlin a far different account of the conversation. After
listening to "a few words" from Miinster concerning the "purpose of his coming," the prime minister had taken command of the interview and declared
that he too was deeply concerned over the political situation in Europe; he
had noted "with satisfaction" that Russia, blinded by an irrational "Slavoph» GP, III, 26-36, 39-42, 52-59, 78-83, 91-99.

ilism," had alienated her old allies and apparently abandoned the Three Emperors League. Britain needed allies and must abandon the old tradition of
nonintervention begun by the Cobdenites. "The most natural allies for England are Germany and Austria. He would enter with pleasure into an alliance
with Germany." The main problem was France and the possibility of a RussianFrench alliance. If Germany should "help" England (and Austria) in the eastern question and in doing so come into conflict with Russia, "we will in that
case keep France quiet [Bismarck: 'nothing else?']; you may depend upon
us.""
At Hughenden Miinster discussed both more and less than his instructions
required. Worst of all, he did not press Disraeli for a full answer to the specific
question Bismarck had asked. On October 8, nevertheless, Bismarck ordered
the ambassador not to pursue the matter. In view of his previous overtures to
Britain, why did the chancellor make this surprising decision? From Salisbury's later remarks to Miinster it is evident that the British government, had
it been asked the right question, would have responded favorably.58 But the
question was not repeated, for by the time Minister's dispatch had arrived
Alexander II, aware of the German-Austrian negotiations and fearful of isolation, had changed course. On September 26 Peter Saburov, newly appointed as Russian ambassador to Constantinople, arrived in Berlin bearing
friendly words from Petersburg. Bismarck and Saburov had already exchanged
views in frank conversations at Kissingen in July and August, and the ambassador had succeeded in influencing the tsar and others at the Russian capital
of the necessity of improved relations with Germany. From Bismarck he now
heard that the purpose of Germany's accord with Austria was to prevent the
latter from allying with England and France against Russia. Now that a ditch
had been dug between Austria and the western powers, it would be possible
to reestablish the Three Emperors League! In Russia, Saburov told him, "the
peace party is now on top; they wish an honorable understanding." Afterward
Bismarck exulted, "Now I have the best receipt for my Vienna policy. I knew
that the Russians would come to us, once we nailed down the Austrians."59
In the weeks and months that followed the signing of the Dual Alliance
Bismarck had exerted himself to reassure the other great powers of its harmlessness—how well he had learned his lesson from the debacle of 1875! In
every direction he described the accord with Austria (the exact terms of

which remained secret on Andrassy's insistence) as nonthreatening, supportive of European stability, and in the interest of other powers.60 Langer has
correctly described the prince's actions in this period as one of the finest examples of the diplomatist's art. "Here was one of those rare statesmen who
could view a given situation from all conceivable angles and adjust his own
actions to meet a large variety of contingencies." To Andrassy he emphasized
one side of the problem; to the Kaiser, another. To the Russians he said that
his goal was restoration of the Three Emperors League, a "triangular rampart"
that would maintain both peace and conservative principles. In London and
Paris he stressed the necessity of erecting a dam against Panslavism and nihilism and spoke of the value of an Anglo-French entente, which would deter
its partners from dangerous adventures. "It will not do to accept any one of
Bismarck's statements as the true exposition of his policy. What he aimed at
was rather a system of checks and balances." What concerned him was primarily the continent and the issues that affected it. "But throughout he aimed
at holding the balance between West and East and at upholding the commanding position of Germany by playing off the one against the other."61

End of the Liberal Era
Ministerial Crisis of 1879
N HIS final speech to the Reichstag defending the tariff bill (July 9,
1879), Bismarck revealed his mood at the end of the legislative session. "Since becoming a minister, I have belonged to no party; nor
could I have belonged to any. I have been successively hated by all
parties and loved by few. The roles have continually changed." Never had he
avenged the hatred and malevolence he had met. His only goal had been to
unify Germany, to fortify the union, and to secure the cooperation of all
forces willing to maintain it. But his expectations of assistance had been repeatedly disappointed. Instead he had been attacked in the press and parliament in a distasteful and repulsive manner.' At this moment of apparent triumph Bismarck played the role of a resentful Messiah, continually deserted
and betrayed by his disciples.
This speech was delivered about two weeks after the resignations of Prussian Ministers Hobrecht, FaIk, and Friedenthal. The news of Hobrecht's defection on June 27 sent Bismarck striding back and forth, his face contorted
with anger. When FaIk and Friedenthal followed suit a day later, he smelled
a plot. The nearly simultaneous departure of the cabinet's three "liberal ministers" was, he assumed, the tip of a "wide-spread intrigue," extending from
the parliamentary opposition (Forckenbeck) to the cabinet and court (particularly Crown Princess Victoria). By precipitating a "ministerial strike" during
the final debate on the tariff bill, the conspirators intended a "deadly embarrassment." To show that he was unshaken, Bismarck filled the vacant posts
with unaccustomed haste.2 As minister of agriculture he chose Robert Lucius
(Ballhausen), owner of a knight's estate and a free conservative leader; as
minister of cultural affairs, Robert von Puttkamer, Pomeranian Junker, conservative deputy, and governor of the province of Silesia; as minister of finance, Karl Bitter, under state secretary in the Ministry of Interior.
Simultaneously Bismarck completed the reorganization of the imperial gov• BR, VIII, 145ft

Kaiser's order of Mar. 16, 1879, admonishing all imperial and Prussian officials who had dealings
with the Reichstag to reject immediately and emphatically any effort to increase the powers of
that body. By its recent actions, he declared, the Reichstag majority had demonstrated its ambition to strike for parliamentary government. DZA Potsdam, Reichskanzlei, 656, pp. i-ia.

ernment that he had planned in 1875. Since Delbriick's dismissal he had
steadily reallocated the power and functions of the Imperial Chancellor's Office (Rekhkanzleramt), ending with abolition of the office itself. In place of a
single executive body, the Reich now possessed eight agencies, headed by
state secretaries acting under the chancellor's authority: Foreign Office, Imperial Admiralty, Imperial Railway Office, Imperial Post Office, Imperial Office of Justice, Imperial Treasury, and Imperial Office of the Interior.3 The
chancellor's need for a personal secretariat was supplied by an Imperial Chancellery (Rekhshmzki), whose initial chief was Tiedemann. The "tractable"
Hofmann accepted a demotion from "president of the Imperial Chancellor's
Office" to "state secretary of the Imperial Office of the Interior." Whatever
pain this caused him was eased by his appointment as Prussian minister of
commerce, an office left vacant by Maybach's appointment as minister of public works.4
Bismarck had created the "imperial ministries" he had once promised, but
not an "imperial cabinet." The state secretaries were not collegial ministers
on the Prussian model, but the subordinates and, under the deputation act of
1878, the deputies of the chancellor, who remained the only responsible minister of the empire. During 1879 Bismarck summoned these officials to three
"conferences" (apparently the formal term Sitzungen appropriate to cabinet
meetings was avoided). At the first conference he stressed that imperial agencies must be sharply separated from their Prussian counterparts. The Prussian
minister of foreign affairs was the only constitutional channel for the transaction of business between Prussia and the Reich, for he alone could instruct
the Prussian vote in the Bundesrat and communicate with other German governments. For this reason that position was held by the Reich chancellor.
"Presidential bills" dealing with imperial affairs, including the budget, were
to be drafted by imperial agencies alone and communicated to the Prussian
ministries only for information.5 No more did he talk of placing Prussian ministers at the head of imperial agencies, and within a year he concluded that
the "personal union" under Hofmann of the Imperial Office of the Interior
and the Prussian Ministry of Commerce was a mistake.6
Although his path had again changed, Bismarck's destination was still the
same—to gain a firm personal grip on the imperial executive and to dominate
the Prussian cabinet. The degree of his success is apparent in the changed
character of the meetings of the Prussian cabinet that he attended. After 1879
the minutes of these sessions generally open with an extended statement by
the minister-president, in which he informed his colleagues what bills were

to be drafted and what policies to be pursued. The ensuing discussions in the
protocols seem, more for clarification than decision-making. The impression
evoked is that of a schoolmaster dictating to pupils.7 Bismarck had reached
the peak of his executive authority after a long and tedious climb marked by
many hesitations and changes of route.
The changes of 1879 also liquidated the last vestiges of the "liberal era."
The very titles of the position Delbriick had held and of the agency he estab'
lished were erased. The imperial government was purged, furthermore, of its
last important defender of laissez-faire economics. Otto Michaelis, who had
assisted Delbriick after 1867 in shaping imperial economic policies, was transferred from his post as director of the financial department of the chancellor's
office to the harmless position of chief administrator of the disabled veterans'
fund (Reichsinvalidenfond). To head the Imperial Treasury Bismarck chose
Adolf Scholz, a career civil servant who had once served a term as conservative deputy in the Prussian Chamber of Deputies. As Scholz's principal subordinate (Direktor), he selected Emil von Burchard who, as Prussian delegate
to the Bundesrat, had recently been effective in steering the protective tariff
bill through the Reichstag. In securing these appointments from the Kaiser,
Bismarck referred specifically to the candidates' political qualifications. This
was a landmark in the history of the Prussian-German bureaucracy. "Here
became visible the beginning in the higher civil service of the transition from
bureaucratic expert to political exponent."8
The ministerial crisis of 1879 reveals again the difficulty of public service
under Bismarck. For a year Hobrecht had swallowed his convictions; privately
opposed to tariff protectionism, he had defended the chancellor's policy in
the Reichstag. The former mayor of Breslau and Berlin now retired to private
life, confessing that he was "unsuited for public service." After months on the
verge, FaIk resigned primarily out of protest against Wilhelm's conservative
course in the affairs of the Protestant church. Bismarck still valued FaIk as a
threat to the papacy but was unable to persuade him to remain. Friedenthal,
whom Bismarck had praised in the preceding year, was now out of favor. The
prince denounced him to Wilhelm as ambitious ("his wife perhaps even more
so") to become chancellor; this "clever Jew" (at a soiree Bismarck is reputed
to have called him a "semitic Hosensch") was the shrewdest of five or six "future ministers" waiting to take office under Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm.
To this end, according to Bismarck, Friedenthal had cultivated liberals as far
to the left as Lasker, and his Catholic wife had exploited her religion to attract
centrists.9
Bismarck found it necessary to explain to his sovereign why so many ministers came and went. Sooner or later, he declared, they discovered that it

was easier to appease rather than oppose parliament. Even the conservative
Friedrich Eulenburg was guilty of this weakness. As the only official responsible for the entire government, the chancellor had constantly to intervene
to halt the drift toward parliamentary government. That only rich men could
afford office (Wilhelm: "? ?") complicated the task of finding ministers capable of upholding the rights of the crown. The effort to locate suitable candidates, Bismarck asserted, had cost him the illness he had suffered in early
1878 at Friedrichsruh.I0 Bismarck thought of himself as the only effective
bulwark against constitutional change in the governmental system he had
devised for Germany. He demanded that ministers and officials who served
him be mere extensions of himself, capable of grasping his purposes and executing his will, but incapable of independent action and higher ambition.

The "Stroke" of 1880
Bismarck's dispute with Wilhelm over the Dual Alliance was hard on the
nerves and health of both, but Bismarck was the one who did the complaining. As he prepared to leave Kissingen on August 19, 1879, he wrote to his
daughter that, although the month's cure had been successful, a surge of work
at the end had caused a "nervous relapse," which he hoped to make good at
Gastein." But at the Austrian spa he had "more to do than in the most difficult times at Berlin." Prevented by his wounded hand from writing more than
a few lines at a time, he dictated up to forty pages a day to Herbert. ,2 Worse
than the work load, however, was the psychological effect of the Kaiser's opposition. "My nerves were most affected by [Wilhelm's] prohibition against
my going to Vienna," he wrote privately to Biilow on August 31. That the
Kaiser held him "on the leash to this extent" affronted his sense of "personal
independence." "Cure and friction" combined had left him "nervous and embittered."13 To Radowitz he wrote, "I have not recovered from the consequences for my health of similar frictions that occurred at Nikolsburg and
Versailles; today my strength is so diminished that I cannot think of attempting to continue to do business under such circumstances." In seventeen years
of service he had done his duty, he declared, and now the Kaiser would have
to find a younger chancellor. His official resignation, he announced, could be
expected within eight to ten days—"if the situation has not changed by
then"!14 Again he demanded that people cease making him sick by opposing

him. The state of his nerves had long since become a weapon with which to
flail his antagonists.
Nervous exhaustion and neuralgia compelled Bismarck to spend a few more
days at Gastein even after Wilhelm finally authorized the trip to Vienna.
After conferring with Andrassy, he returned to Berlin on September 25 for
the final showdown with the Kaiser—their worst confrontation ever in WiIhelm's opinion. From there he dispatched to the Kaiser a series of messages,
mostly telegrams, that became increasingly tart and scarcely in accord with
his role as the monarch's "vassal." On receiving word from Baden-Baden that
one of his telegrams had cost the Kaiser a sleepless night and jangled nerves,
Bismarck wired back sarcastically that he and his aide Billow had "for weeks
known nothing but sleepless nights." When the Kaiser finally yielded on October 8, the chancellor asked immediately for permission to take another
leave in the country.15 On the following day he departed for Varzin, where
he promptly fell ill—worn out, he said, by six weeks of "uninterrupted daily
struggles with the Kaiser." For two months he went from bed to sofa and back
again, unable, as he told Andrassy, to regain the strength he had expended
"in the service of my master and country." "My stomach—that loyal but
much abused servant—has refused further service," he wrote to his son-inlaw, "because I have used up elsewhere the gall to which it has a right."16 The
joke had substance. At Varzin on December 13, 1879, Lucius reported that
the prince "has had a severe attack of gall bladder disease accompanied by
acute pains (perhaps a gallstone). He has been very sick and his cardiac sound
was so weak that Dr. Struck became quite anxious. But the recent passage of
the railway act made him half well again. I found him in his pajamas busy
with a huge bowl of stew (bouillon, rice, and pigeons) and eating with good
appetite." Next day, however, Lucius speculated that the prince's problem
was a "liver ailment" and, given his constitution, a sudden collapse was quite
possible.'7 From Herbert, Tiedemann heard that the chancellor was plagued
by neuralgia and by Pomerania's snowy "rheumatism climate," which affected
his nerves. Whether a matter presented to him would produce boredom or
anger was impossible to predict; usually, the latter.l8
For more than three months during the winter of 1879-1880, the German
chancellor could perform no more than minimal duty. Not until January 27,

1880, was he fit to travel to Berlin. Two weeks later Lucius reported that the
prince had returned "eager for work, interfering in every branch of government, irritable and not easy to handle." His effort to protect landowners
threatened to impede passage of an agricultural bill on which Lucius had
worked for months. To Busch and Baroness Spitzemberg the chancellor complained in March of tiring easily, being unable to walk or stand for long periods without suffering neuralgia. Another visitor, Booth, noted four glasses full
of pills on the prince's table, but found him looking well, although denying
it. Anyone who had been a violin string for eighteen years, Bismarck said,
was unusable. "Someday I will vanish like a cloud."19 That this last thought
was not casual became clear on March 30, 1880, when Bismarck by his own
diagnosis suffered a stroke.
At dinner that evening he consumed six hardboiled eggs spread with butter, "endless quantities of iced May wine," and a bottle of port after which,
his face flushed, he complained of feeling ill. He left the room, evidently to
vomit, and returned pale and stammering "like a drunken person." His cheek
muscles and the back of his head felt paralysed. After a sleepless night of
vomiting, the prince's speech was still impaired. Struck diagnosed the ailment
as stomach influenza temporarily affecting the facial muscles. But Bismarck,
"more obstinate than ever," upbraided the doctor and, ignoring his advice,
ate a heavy meal of chicken soup, meat, and vegetables, then went for a walk
in the rain. Johanna summoned Ernst von Leyden, university professor and
prominent internist, who confirmed Struck's finding. But Bismarck persisted
in the belief that his affliction was a stroke, blaming it on the difficulties of
government service. Not until a third physician—Oskar Schanzenbach, who
spoke "more firmly and categorically"—had confirmed the diagnosis did Bismarck accept it. "Whether 1 die now or in five years is a matter of indifference," the patient stammered. "For you, yes," a guest replied, "but not for us
and the fatherland." "Who knows?" said Bismarck, "perhaps it would be better."20

litical and legislative affairs. During August-September 1879 occurred the
campaign for election of the Prussian Chamber of Deputies that ended at the
polls on October 7. The legislative session of the Landtag began on October
28, 1879, and ended on July 3, 1880, being interrupted by the Reichstag
session from February 12 to June 15, 1880. The Bundesrat convened on September 15, 1879, and adjourned on June 30, 1880, an unusually long and at
times agitated session. Although important bills were pending in all of these
bodies, the German chancellor and Prussian minister-president appeared only
once in the Reichstag (May 8, 1880), twice in the Bundesrat (June 8 and 14,
1880), and not at all in the Landtag.
The Prussian election of October 7, 1879, was the first test of the political
consequences of the protective tariff. At Bismarck's direction the government
press began in August to brand the election of deputies "like Forckenbeck,
Stauffenberg, Lasker, and Richter as synonymous with free trade, economic
misery, and high direct taxes."21 Richter and his associates launched their
campaign with the slogan, "Bismarck must go," concentrating on the "misguided" economic policy of the government—with catastrophic results.22
Again voters gave the chancellor what he seemed to want. The coalition that
had passed the Franckenstein clause scored an overwhelming victory, the
conservatives rising from 34 to 104, free conservatives from 34 to 54, centrists
from 88 to 96, and Poles from 15 to 19 seats, while the national liberals sank
from 175 to 101, the progressives from 67 to 35 seats.23 Among those missing
from the newly elected chamber were many left-liberals, including Lasker, for
whom no seat could be found in the runoff election. Even Richter was defeated in his home district, Hagen, but managed in the runoff to gain a seat
in Berlin. Particularly damaging were the losses suffered by liberals in rural
areas; the progressives lost 13 of 23 seats they held in East Prussia, long a
progressive stronghold. Richter was confident that the setback was temporary.24 But Prussian liberals never recovered from the defeat of 1879. The
three-class system, coupled with no reapportionment, kept them a minority
in the lower chamber, which became, like the House of Lords, a bastion of
conservative and agrarian power.
Before the assembly met, the Conservative party, which since 1872 had
been divided into two caucuses (the "old" and "new" conservatives) reunited,
giving the party the capacity to form a majority either with the Center and

its Polish allies or with free conservatives and national liberals.25 Bismarck
was disturbed by this fusion. In every "winged party," he wrote, leadership
tends to migrate to the extremes. The ultraconservatives were "not usable
allies or would not remain so," while the continued presence of "Laskerites"
in the National Liberal party gave to "nihilists" and "republicans" (that is,
Poles, progressives, and "progressives masked as national liberals") the
chance to sway the chamber on crucial issues. As dangerous as these extremists, or nearly so, was the Center party, whose loyalty to the government
could not be bought by any concessions in the Kulturkampf. "The govern'
ment will not be able to manage for long with a majority dependent for its
existence on the goodwill of the Center."26 From Varzin Bismarck intrigued
for an alternative majority, one more amenable to his program. The free conservatives, he wrote to Lucius, could become the "decisive element" in the
chamber by forming the nucleus of a coalition of moderates drawn from the
Conservative and National Liberal parties. To this end he persuaded Bennigsen to reverse his decision to retire from politics and even promoted the Hanoverian's candidacy for the presidency of the chamber. But the Conservative
party joined with the Center to defeat Bennigsen and to elect its own slate of
candidates. The combination that Bismarck himself had encouraged by accepting the Franckenstein clause appeared to dominate the Chamber of Deputies^—much to his alarm.27
The prince ordered his associates to avoid opting for any combination of
parties; otherwise the government would be dependent upon the favored coalition, whose leaders, be they liberals or conservatives, would try to govern.28 What he aimed for was the converse, namely dependence of the major
parties on the government. His object was to keep them always hungering,
but never totally starved for influence, willing to be in the minority on some
issues in the hope of escaping it on others. During the coming legislative
session he needed the support of national liberals on a number of important
bills that the Center was sure to oppose. But he also needed to preserve the
option of continuing the Kulturkampf as a means of softening resistance by
the Catholic church to his own terms for its liquidation. Bismarck's overtures
to Bennigsen and his suggestion that moderate liberals and conservatives cooperate brought sighs of relief from the former. "This combination would be,"
one of them wrote, "the strongest dam against a reaction in school and

church, that is, against the reaction that we all really fear."29 This mood
helped produce the majority in the Chamber of Deputies that, in December
1879, passed Maybach's bill for public ownership of four major railway lines;30
in June 1880, four bills for administrative reform;31 and, in July 1880, the first
"utilization statute" (to be discussed in the next section).
In the Reichstag national liberals also joined with the conservative parties
in passing two crucial bills: renewals of the iron budget of 1874 and antisocialist act of 1878. The government's military bill was submitted to the
Reichstag in February 1880 well in advance of the expiration date (December
31, 1881) of the Septennat of 1874. It called for increases in the size of the
armed forces corresponding to the growth in population, participation by the
first segment of the reserve in peacetime maneuvers, and an increase in military appropriations of about 25 percent. Recent international crises, the apparent alienation of Russia, the possibility of a two-front war, and the
strengthening of French and Russian armies made a persuasive case for passage, which Bismarck heightened by launching a scare story in the newspaper
press.32 To the progressives and to Lasker and his associates, however, the
vital issue was the government's demand that parliament relinquish for seven
more years its right to review annually the military budget. They had bitter
memories of the manipulations by which Bismarck had produced a majority
for the Septennat of 1874. Yet liberals were hardly in a position to regain in
1880 ground lost in 1874 at the height of their parliamentary strength. Speaking for the "overwhelming majority" of his political friends, Bennigsen abdicated all judgment in military and foreign affairs; it was foolish for deputies to
assume that they understand these matters better than the experts—Bismarck, Moltke, and Kameke. He praised Bismarck for concluding an alliance
with Austria-Hungary against "strong resistance in important circles" and to
the applause of "all Germany." Defeat of the bill depended upon the number
of "Laskerites" willing to join a motley opposition of centrists, progressives,
social democrats, Poles, Guelphs, and Alsace-Lorrainers. But the defectors
were only four—Lasker, Stauffenberg, Bamberger, and Forckenbeck33—and
the statute passed, 186 to 128. The "Laskerites" were generals without troops.
The government's bill for renewal of the antisocialist act until 1884 was
also introduced well in advance of the expiration date (March 31, 1881). Like
the Septennat, it enjoyed smooth passage through the Bundesrat in February

1880. In the Reichstag the two conservative parties and most national liberals
hoped for passage without much debate. Among the latter only Lasker, who
had voted for the statute of 1878 with great misgivings, denounced the "exceptional law" and the abuses committed by the governments in executing it.
Progressives (especially Hanel) prolonged the discussion by charging again
that the statute violated civil rights, diminished popular confidence in the
empire as a Recfitsstaat, and was ineffective in halting the progress of socialism. Naturally the social democrats, heartened by recent successes in by-elections, exploited the debate to propagate views on social reform that they
could no longer express in newspapers and public meetings. The Center,
which in 1878 had voted solidly against the statute, split over the issue; a
conservative wing headed by the Bavarian Count Georg von Hertling supported the government, while the majority, whose spokesman was Windthorst, remained in opposition. The conservative wing enjoyed the prospect
of being in harmony with Bismarck and had lost the fear that centrists as well
as socialists might be victims of the statute's proscription of subversive activity. Windthorst, on the other hand, rebuked the governments for exceeding
the limits of the 1878 statute in their pursuit of socialist agitators. His followers stressed that they were not opposed to the bill on grounds of principle but
of impracticality. On May 4, 1880, the statute passed overwhelmingly, 191
to 94; fourteen centrists voted with the majority.34
Legislative Defeats, 1880
While significant, these victories were overshadowed by legislative defeats in
both Reichstag and Landtag. Yet another assault by the government upon the
Reichstag's power over the budget came to naught. To Bismarck the necessity
of drafting and defending yearly budgets had become "unbearable"—"an unceasing, restless activity that exhausts all concerned and uses up parliament
itself."35 He proposed to amend the constitution to provide for biennial rather
than annual budgets and for Reichstag elections every fourth rather than every third year. This extension would have made it possible to summon Reichstag and Landtag into session in alternate years. Richter speculated that the
bill was a mere decoy put up for the national liberals to shoot down in order
to feel better about accepting the Septennat.36 However that may be, the bill

Minister of Justice Fnedenthal proposed an interval of eight years between elections, to which
Bismarck replied that, while he had nothing against that idea "in principle," he thought it "more
expedient" to let the extension of the legislative period appear as a logical "consequence" of the
extension of the budget period.

itself has to be taken seriously—another sign of the chancellor's growing determination to depreciate the importance of both parliaments. For many years
he insisted that the government must discharge its responsibility by presenting bills it regarded as necessary whether or not passage was likely. That the
Reichstag simply tabled the bill in question did not surprise him. By contrast,
its rejection of the "Samoa bill" was an unexpected and stinging defeat.
In recent decades German companies, led by Godeffroy and Sons of Hamburg, had gained a near monopoly of trade with the Polynesian islands centering on Samoa, whose importance to German exports was expected to grow
following completion of the Panama Canal. Although the trade was profitable, Godeffroy became insolvent in 1879 owing to unwise investments in
German mining operations; an English creditor, the banking house of Baring,
was eager to foreclose and assume the assets. With Bismarck's encouragement
a consortium of German bankers headed by Bleichroder and Hansemann,
with participation by the Prussian Seehandlung, formed a corporation to take
over the Godeffroy enterprise, but they demanded that the Reich guarantee
dividends of at least 4.5 percent to investors. This arrangement was not uncommon, having been used in Prussia and other states for the encouragement
of railway construction. Bismarck concluded that preservation and expansion
of the German commercial position in the South Pacific was a vital "national
interest," a view, urged upon him by Bleichroder and by Bernhard von Biilow,
that was soon widely trumpeted in the official press.37 In the Reichstag and
liberal press the free traders—Bamberger in the forefront—denounced the
"swindle," denying that the rescue of Godeffroy by the taxpayers was a matter
of national patriotism. At the end of April 1880 the bill was defeated, 128 to
112, the Center joining the progressives and 21 national liberals in the majority.38
Even more humiliating for Bismarck was the fate of the tax reform program
that had become since 1875 his principal objective in domestic affairs. Under
the Franckenstein clause incorporated in the tariff act of 1879, Prussia was to
receive millions of marks in customs and tobacco tax revenues annually from
the Reich. Yet this did not suffice to provide the tax relief for low income
groups and property owners that Bismarck had planned when he proposed in
1878 that Germany shift "from the false path of direct taxes onto the smooth
track of indirect taxes."39 New and higher imperial taxes were necessary if the
states were to receive the revenues from the Reich needed to execute the

proposed tax relief. To entice the Reichstag to grant those taxes, Bismarck
and his associates proposed to demonstrate in advance how the funds they
would produce were to be expended by the Prussian Landtag. The pleasure of
reducing old taxes was to ease the pain of imposing new ones. In July 1880
the Landtag passed a "utilization statute" (Verwendungsgesetz) providing for
liquidation of the four lowest brackets of the class tax, fusion of the upper
brackets with the income tax, and allocation of one-half of all real estate tax
revenues to local governments (Kommunalverbande).*0
Even without the Prussian request for money with which to fund this reform, the German Reichstag would have had a major fiscal problem in 18801881. Increased expenditures for the Reich, particularly for the army, led to
a prospective deficit of 44,900,000 marks, despite increased revenues expected from customs under the tariff act of 1879. Without new indirect taxes
the imperial government must either borrow money or increase assessments
on the states. The government introduced three revenue bills, calling for increases in the brewing tax (a request that had failed in 1879), in the stamp
tax (a measure that went beyond the bill defeated in 1878 by.including business receipts and bank checks), and a new "defense tax" (Wehrsteuer), to be
paid by those not drafted into the armed services.41 While passing the budget
bill for 1880-1881 expeditiously, the Reichstag took no action on the brewing
and stamp taxes; the defense tax died in the Bundesrat. Having swallowed the
Septennat again, the liberal and centrist deputies were in no mood to make
further sacrifices in parliamentary budget power. But they also had solid backing from brewers, bankers, and businessmen whose interests were affected.42
Rumors of another government bill inaugurating a tobacco monopoly generated a coalition of progressives, national liberals, and centrists, which on
April 28 affirmed its understanding that the government had permanently
surrendered this goal in bargaining for the tariff act of 1879.43

sia, whose income from direct taxes was shrinking owing to the depression,
could not offer tax relief to low income groups and local governments.44 The
conduct of the Center party in allying with left-liberals to bring about defeat
of the tax program in the Reichstag justified Bismarck's prognosis of the preceding fall. His manipulations had not succeeded in creating the deferential
Reichstag majority of moderates that he wanted, and his strategy of creating
alternating majorities by playing the centrists and national liberals off against
one another had enjoyed but limited success. Nor had he succeeded in exploiting the Prussian Landtag's desire for financial relief to extract concessions
from the Reichstag.

Disciplining the Bundesrat
The most startling event of the legislative year 1879-1880 was not the revolt
of the Reichstag and Chamber of Deputies, but that of the lesser states in the
Bundesrat. Since 1867 German dynasties and governments had largely accepted Prussian leadership. As Bismarck had planned, the Reichstag was an
effective counterweight to the upper chamber of the imperial government.
The states had reason to fear for their existence as long as the chancellor
emphasized the unitary side of the constitutional balance and collaborated
with the national liberals against "particularism." They sought safety in cooperation with Bismarck, apprehensive that opposition would drive him even
further into the arms of the parties favoring centralization, an anxiety that
Bismarck readily exploited. But now the wind had changed; Bismarck's break
with the liberals emboldened the states to become more active in protecting
their interests. As shown, their opposition frustrated the chancellor's plan for
a nationalized railway system and even for an Imperial Railway Office
equipped with effective powers to regulate freight rates.
While Bismarck swallowed this result, it may have influenced his decision
in early 1880 to tighten his control over the Bundesrat and the federal states.
To that end he launched a two-pronged offensive: one aimed at his underlings, the other at the ministers of the federal states. In March Hofmann was
again sharply reminded that under the constitution only the Prussian minister
of foreign affairs (that is, Bismarck) could instruct Prussian delegates to the
Bundesrat; without his prior knowledge and approval no Prussian bills could
be presented to that chamber; as the chancellor's deputy, furthermore, Hofmann had no authority to act except in conformity with Bismarck's policies.45
At a dinner for Bundesrat delegates on March 15, the prince explained that

the Bundesrat was intended to be the "Aeropag of the German nation," where
Germany's leading statesmen assembled to deliberate on national affairs. Instead cabinet ministers had remained away, sending lesser officials as deputies.
As a consequence vital decisions were made in Bundesrat committees under
the influence of Prussian privy counselors "with their bureaucratic traits." As
a remedy he proposed yearly conferences lasting two to three weeks, during
which the ministers would take their seats in the Bundesrat to deliberate upon
significant legislative bills, leaving minor ones to their deputies in later sessions. "His purpose in this is to strengthen the federal element, to heighten
the prestige of the Bundesrat in Germany, and to work against unitary movements."46
Scarcely two weeks after this demarche, an episode occurred in the Bundesrat that sharply revealed Bismarck's actual vision of it as a deliberative
body. On April 3, a few days after the prince's "stroke," Paul Fischer, a high
official in the Imperial Post Office, appeared in the Bundesrat to support a
Wiirttemberg proposal to exempt receipts issued by the postal system from the
proposed stamp tax. Since Hofmann and Bitter had defended the tax, to
which the chancellor himself attached so much importance, the delegates
were treated with a rare case of open conflict within the government. There
were "mocking smiles," some said laughter, and the chamber proceeded by a
narrow majority to adopt the Wiirttemberg amendment.47 When told of this
scene, Bismarck "boiled over." Since Heinrich Stephan, chief of the postal
service, was unavailable, he peremptorily summoned the next in command,
an unsuspecting official who arrived proudly for his first face-to-face interview
with the German chancellor, only to come stumbling out a moment later,
visibly shaken, to fetch the hapless Fischer. To the latter Bismarck said a "few
pleasant things" such as, "When I signed your appointment recently, I wondered at your youth; but you are much younger than your years." The stammer
was gone.
Next morning, Tiedemann found the prince, after a sleepless night, Gotha
Almanac in hand, calculating that the thirty delegates forming the Bundesrat
majority on the postal receipt issue represented 7,500,000 people; the minority of twenty-eight, 33,000,000. This, he fulminated, was "absolutely contrary to the spirit of the imperial constitution." He could not defend in the
Reichstag decisions of the Bundesrat with which he disagreed.48 At top speed

he dictated a despatch to the Kaiser requesting release from office. As arranged, Wilhelm replied by suggesting that the chancellor propose changes
in Bundesrat procedures that would prevent a recurrence of such a situation.49
In newspaper articles written by Tiedemann and Busch, Prussian officials were
publicly rebuked for the "lack of discipline" that had developed during the
chancellor's absences from Berlin; a case was made for shifting power from
Bundesrat committees to that body's plenum.'°
In Bismarck's dealings with legislative bodies, "resignation" had become a
euphemism for ultimatum. To the Reichstag it meant that the chamber must
either capitulate or be dissolved and face new elections. To the Bundesrat it
meant that the states must either capitulate or accept the dissolution and
reconstruction of the Reich. If the "spirit" of the treaties of 1867 and 1871
were violated, Prussia would withdraw from the federal union on the grounds
that its governmental machinery had become unworkable; the national union
must then be reconstituted at the cost of either the representative principle
(the Reichstag) or the federal principle (the Bundesrat). What Bismarck
threatened was a Staatsstreich, a warning that became all too familiar in the
decade ahead. This was the message that Bismarck broadcast in veiled form
in the official press and, more bluntly, in his private messages to the state
governments.5' It had the desired effect. Hastening to Berlin, the ministers
had devised. Prussian and imperial officials had the legal right to participate in Bundesrat deliberations only as Prussian delegates to that body or as deputies of delegates, both of which required
royal appointment. But the rule had been laxly observed in the daily transaction of legislative
business. Fischer's mistake was not in testifying in the Bundesrat without such an appointment,
but in testifying the wrong way. As Prussian minister of finance, Bitter had tried, by his own
testimony, to persuade Fischer not to testify against the proposed tax. Stephan defended his
subordinate on the grounds that the imperial post office had received no advance notice of the
stamp tax bill, although its interests were affected. Nevertheless, he disavowed Fischer's actions
as unauthorized (Bismarck: "Zuchtlos!"). Disciplinary proceedings brought Fischer a formal reprimand. Bismarck used the occasion to lecture his officials, the state governments, and the public
about constitutional relationships. But Hofmann, who as presiding officer had permitted Fischer
to speak in the Bundesrat, was the chief victim. The episode reinforced Bismarck's growing determination to be rid of him. DZA Potsdam, Reichskanzlei, 1967 (Die Vorgdnge in der BundesTathssiuung vom yen April 1880), pp. 5-139.

527

In the past Prussia had on occasion been outvoted in the Bundesrat,
and yet the chancellor had never before reacted so strongly.53 By demonstrating the lengths to which he was willing to go to reverse an unfavorable vote, he gained in effect a suspensive veto over the chamber's decisions.54 Yet he assured the states simultaneously that he was a defender
of their interests and of federalism in general. The federal states, he declared,
provided a much stronger barrier to "the advance of republicanism, which
is evident in the Reichstag and in Europe as a whole, than would be possible
in a unitary state, where only a single government, not a majority of governments, would stand opposed to the Reichstag."55 While this sentiment was
probably sincere, Bismarck's effort to gain a firmer grip upon the Bundesrat
had the same consequence as his previous efforts to heighten his influence
over the Reichstag and Chamber of Deputies. He elevated his own power at
the cost of the system of institutional checks and balances he had created in
the Reich constitution. The effect of his narcissistic compulsion upon German federalism can be seen in a passage from Lucius's diary, which summarizes
a conversation the minister had on April 20, 1880, with King Johann of Saxony, who had just returned from a visit with the German chancellor. Although still pleasant, Johann reported, Bismarck had aged and was prone to
anger. "When the king uttered a differing opinion, Bismarck changed his
expression, and the king immediately yielded. It is Bismarck's misfortune, the
king declared, that he cannot listen to a contrary opinion and immediately
conjectures ulterior motives. This is what happened in the vote on the stamp
tax bill, when no one knew that the matter was important to him. Everyone
does his will, the Kaiser first of all."56

The Coercion of Bremen and Hamburg
The same authoritarian tendency can be seen in Bismarck's campaign of 1880
to force Bremen and Hamburg into the Zollverein. Article 34 of the imperial
constitution provided that the two ports at the mouths of the Weser and Elbe
Rivers "with such of their own territory and with such adjacent regions as may
be necessary for this purpose, shall remain free ports outside the common
customs frontier, until they ask to be included within it." Earlier both had
surrendered some "adjacent regions," but retained the outports of Bremerha53

ven and Cuxhaven and, in Hamburg's case, the Prussian town of Altona. 57
During the drive for a protective tariff in May 1879 Bismarck prodded both
cities to initiate their inclusion in the Zollverein. Neither complied. Instead
they increased from 3 to 5 marks per head the sum paid annually to the Reich
in lieu of tariffs.58 On April 19, 1880, the Bundesrat received from Prussia,
without prior warning to Hamburg, a bill incorporating Altona and part of
adjacent St. Pauli into the customs union. Since both were practically inseparable geographically and commercially from Hamburg, this was actually an
attempt to force the latter and, by precedent, Bremen as well into the Zollverein.59
On April 28 Hamburg countered by challenging the constitutionality of
the incorporation of St. Pauli, which had become one of its suburbs. But
Prussian delegates to the Bundesrat took the position that the issue was economic, not constitutional. The Bavarian delegate, Gideon von Rudhart,
stalled for time by declaring that he must await instructions from his government, but volunteered the opinion that the fate of St. Pauli was indeed a
constitutional matter. Next day, on arriving with his wife at Bismarck's parliamentary soiree, he was verbally assaulted by his host in full hearing of the
other guests. The envoy, who had a reputation for integrity, joviality, and
ineffectuality, was castigated for opposing the "well-known intentions" of
Germany's chancellor and of participating in a "conspiracy" of ultramontanes, Hamburg Jews, and progressives. The Bavarian summoned his carriage,
left the party, never returned to the Bundesrat, and was soon reassigned by
his government.60
On May 5 Bismarck himself appeared—a rare occasion—to chair the Bundesrat's tariff committee. Never, he declared, would he grant that the Hamburg issue had a constitutional dimension. The exclusion of the two Hanseatic cities from the Zollverein had always been regarded as temporary; their
free ports could be limited to dock and warehouse areas on the waterfront.
"As I see the matter, a situation could arise out of this for Prussia like the one
that existed in the Bundesrat in June 1866." Nevertheless, he agreed to bypass
the constitutional issue by letting a committee of experts determine the most
feasible line for the new customs frontier. Except for Hamburg, the state governments leaped at this solution. The experts settled the matter by leaving
the whole of St. Pauli within the Hamburg free zone.6'
" When the North German Confederation was founded in 1867, Lauenburg, the two duchies
of Mecklenburg, and the Hanseatic cities of Liibeck, Bremen, and Hamburg were still outside
the customs union. By 1871 all but the last two had joined, although Lubeck retained some
entrepot privileges. W. O. Henderson, The Zollverein (London, 1968), pp. 301, 310-312, 330.

Obviously bigger issues were at stake for Bismarck than merely the fate of
Altona and St. Pauli. Although the bill of April 19 claimed that Altona had
suffered from the connection with Hamburg, this was not the opinion of its
merchants and city government.62 In the end it proved to be infeasible to
separate even Altona from Hamburg by a customs frontier; the Bundesrat ordinance of May 22, 1880, that authorized its inclusion was never executed.63
The attack on Bremen and Hamburg had a more political and nationalistic
than economic and fiscal purpose. Bismarck wanted to liquidate this "foreign
bridgehead on German soil."64 That the two ports lay outside the tariff wall
he had erected around fortress Germany was as difficult for him to accept as
was the presence of non-Germanized (in his sense of the term) Poles, Danes,
and Frenchmen within the imperial borders. But the chancellor was also bent
on imposing his will on the medium and small states by shock tactics of the
kind that shook Rudhart. In a dispatch of May 6 to Prussian envoys at the
German courts, which was published in order to emphasize its gravity, he
declared that as chancellor his duty was to counter particularistic sympathies
of the German states as well as the centralistic inclinations of the Reichstag.
Any attempt by the states to outvote Prussia on a constitutional issue would
re-create circumstances similar to those in the Bundesrat between 1848 and
1866.65 The message was clear: if crossed on a fundamental issue, Prussia
would withdraw from the treaties of federation signed in 1866 and 1870, and
German unity would be jeopardized.
The struggle in the Bundesrat had repercussions in the Reichstag. In reply
to an interpellation on May 1, Adolf SchoIz, state secretary of the Imperial
Treasury, speaking for Bismarck, flatly denied that the Reichstag had any
voice in the matter. But Richter, Lasker, and Windthorst all rejected this
position; Richter charged the government with having violated the constitution.66 Through a leaked document (a letter from Bismarck to Bitter) the
deputies had learned that the chancellor intended to unlimber yet another
weapon against the Hanseatic cities—a Bundesrat ordinance incorporating
into the Zollverein the entire estuary of the Elbe, stretching one hundred
kilometers from Hamburg to the sea. Duties were henceforth to be collected
at Cuxhaven or Gluckstadt, where ships entered the estuary, rather than at
Hamburg or at small ports on the Elbe, where goods were landed. This proand Hermann (Bavaria) stood up to Bismarck's bullying in this session—particularly Hermann,
who at the end was rewarded by a handshake from the chancellor.

posal posed an even greater threat to the entrepot trade of Germany's greatest
seaport.67 Ordinarily a Bundesrat ordinance was not subject to debate in the
Reichstag. But Rudolf Delbriick, now a Reichstag deputy, found a way. In the
draft of an Austro-German Elbe navigation treaty he detected a clause that
was intended to pave the way for incorporation of the estuary under international law. Since it dealt with commerce, the treaty could be discussed in the
Reichstag, and opposition deputies seized the chance to open up the Hamburg-Bremen issue.68
This debate was the occasion for Bismarck's only appearance in the Reichstag during the entire session. The chancellor scolded the deputies for intervening in matters beyond their constitutional competence. Liberals had lost
their enthusiasm for German unity and were making common cause with particularism. Those who had once glowed for the "national idea" now went
"arm in arm" with centrists and others inimical to the Reich. The hostile
attitude of the Center over the last six months, he declared, had destroyed
his trust in negotiations with the curia. Their conduct was always a barometer
of Rome's intentions. Had those who joined the centrists in opposition to the
government considered the consequences of their actions for the constitution? It was a dangerous game to encourage lesser states to outvote Prussia in
the Bundesrat. For thirty years he had struggled for German unity, during
eighteen of which he had accumulated hatreds like every minister long in
power. Only the wishes of the Kaiser kept him at his post. If compelled to
resign, he would advise the Kaiser to seek his replacement from candidates
acceptable to centrists and conservatives. To him it was a matter of indifference if his successor went to Canossa.60
Bismarck had no compelling reason to address the Reichstag on the navigation treaty, which went into effect without that body's approval, or on the
incorporation of the Elbe estuary, which the Bundesrat had the power to effect and did so on May 22, 1880. Nor did he need Reichstag support in forcing
Hamburg and Bremen into the Zollverein. Under continual pressure from the
chancellery, Hamburg capitulated in 1881, Bremen in 1884.7° Bismarck's

rare episode in the Bismarck era. Bismarck's private reaction is unrecorded; publicly he reacted
coolly. Through the Norddeutsche Aligememe Zeitung he declared that his position on the Zollverein issue was well known. A chancellor who failed to complete the national unification of
Germany "by all constitutional means" would be guilty of neglecting his duty and should be
dismissed. If he had known that the opposition placed so much value on finding out that he was
doing his duty, he would have written ten such letters for them. SEG (1880), p. 205; Norddeutsche AUgemeine Zeitung, Vol. 19, No. 243, July 25, 1880.

speech of May 8 was an act of personal defiance and contempt. Threats and
reproaches flew like angry sparks from a grinding wheel. German patriots he
threatened with the loss of national unity, particularists with a reduction in
federalism, ultramontanes with renewal of the Kulturkampf, liberals with its
abandonment by a reactionary government. Only the conservatives, who had
consistently backed his legislation in Reichstag and Landtag, escaped his
wrath. Again he depicted himself as an object of universal ingratitude, as a
statesman isolated and misunderstood, standing for the common rather than
partisan interest, bearing his heavy burden despite illness and fatigue. "I am
tired," he said, "dead tired."71

Enabling Act and Secession
During the last six months of 1879 serious efforts were made to negotiate an
end to the Kulturkampf. By his appointments to the curia Leo XIII surrounded
himself with churchmen who wanted a settlement, while the new Kwitusmmister in Berlin, Puttkamer, a staunch Lutheran conservative, was eager to
abandon the course followed by FaIk. During October-November delegations
led by Papal Nuncio Cardinal Jacobini and German Ambassador Prince Heinrich VII Reuss negotiated in Vienna. Bismarck remained skeptical of the out'
come, unconvinced that either party could meet the demands of the other,
and doubtful that the Center party, whatever the concessions made to it in
religious matters, could be harnessed to the government wagon. When the
Center opposed the railway purchase act and other government measures in
December 1879, he ordered Puttkamer and Reuss to let the negotiations stagnate without explanation. They had served at least to let him smoke out the
wants and demands of the papacy.72
In late February 1880, Leo sought to revive the negotiation by holding out
the prospect of a partial concession in the matter of the Anzeigepflicht (that is,
the church's obligation to notify the government of nominations for and appointments to ecclesiastical offices), which Bismarck had declared to be the

and sought to keep Bennigsen politically active. His enthusiastic allies in the struggle were to
help him liquidate it on favorable terms. Oncken, Bennigsen, H, 430. Yet when FaIk was gone,
Bismarck exploited his successor's conservatism to signal his own good faith in negotiations with
the papacy. The first sign of Puttkamer's new course was a decision not to convert on schedule a
Protestant into a nondenominational school at Elbing, a step that alarmed liberals but not Bismarck. Lucius, Bismarck-Ennnerungen, pp. 180-181.

chief obstacle to a repeal of the May laws. Through Jacobini the pope let it
be known, furthermore, that more concessions were in prospect, once the
Vatican had gained satisfaction on other matters such as reinstatement of
74
bishops. In a cabinet meeting Puttkamer, seconded by Friedberg, argued
hotly for a favorable response. But Bismarck attributed to the pope's overture
only a "theoretical importance." The offered concession applied only to lesser
clergy, did not clearly yield to the state the right to veto candidates, and could
easily be revoked. Instead of repealing any of the May laws, Bismarck insisted
that the government secure from the Landtag an enabling act giving it discre­
tionary power in their enforcement. "One must have authority to close an
eye, as long as peace is maintained by the other side."75 On April 12, he
publicly announced the government's intention to seek this authority; simultaneously he proposed to resume diplomatic relations with the Holy See. 76 He
wanted to outdo the pope in the game of good faith by shifting the negotiations to Rome, while gaining through the enabling act a flexible position that
would permit him to ease the government's relations with Catholics, offering
immediate rewards for good behavior on the part of the Center party, yet
preserving the option of reviving the Kulturkampf if he deemed it necessary.77
These successive developments created consternation in many quarters.
On hearing that the pope had softened on the requirement for notification,
Windthorst exclaimed, "Shot! Shot in front of the enemy. Shot in the
back!" 78 The government's announced plan for an enabling act also embarrassed the Center, already rent by differences between compromisers and in­
transigents over the antisocialist act. That the public was left in the dark
concerning the contents of the bill for a full month added to the confusion.
In messages to Rome, articles planted in the press, and a Reichstag speech of
May 8, 1880, Bismarck exploited the situation by contrasting the peace policy
of the papacy with obstructionism by centrists who collaborated with progres­
sives, free traders, socialists, Guelphs, Poles, and other "enemies of the
Reich." 79 In communications to Windthorst and other centrist deputies (Paul
Majunke and Franz Moufang) the Vatican instructed the Center to continue

agitating for repeal of the May laws, keep a free hand in purely political questions, and reserve judgment on the enabling act until its actual provisions
were revealed. But Leo also left no doubt that the party was to have no role
in any negotiations to end the Kulturkampf; that role was reserved for sovereign heads of state.80
The Center was not the only party upset by the enabling act. Even rightwing liberals were incensed by the government's request for authority of unlimited duration to permit pastors to extend their services to neighboring vacant parishes, the recall of government administrators from vacant dioceses,
resumption of financial support by the state, and replacement of state administrators by vicars chosen by cathedral chapters. Bennigsen declared that only
the curia could rejoice at such proposals.81 Yet the pope promptly condemned
the bill as insufficient.83 In the Chamber of Deputies a struggle developed
between centrists, who sought to convert the bill into a full repeal of the May
laws, and liberals, who endeavored to reduce the discretionary power it
granted. Although he tried to influence Bennigsen in private talks, Bismarck
refused to reveal what he would accept in the way of amendments, complicating the search for a compromise. Ultimately Bennigsen, who in disgust was
again considering retirement from politics, brought together a coalition of
conservatives, free conservatives, and right-wing national liberals that passed
the bill by a majority of four (June 28, 1880), but only after vital paragraphs,
including that which allowed the reinstatement of bishops, had been excised.83 The result was a mutilated statute, which Bismarck, nevertheless,
permitted to be enacted into law. "The session ended," wrote Lucius, "in
general discord."84

* The Change of Front Completed, 1 8 7 9 - 1 8 8 0 *

That Bismarck appeared to be in a good mood as he listened to Bennigsen's
complaints may have been due to the latter's confession that the issue of the
enabling act was the final wedge that would split apart the National Liberal
party—a Bismarck objective since 1875.85 Yet the crack between moderates
and democrats was not of Bismarck's making; nor was the final cleavage his
direct responsibility. The division was as old as the liberal movement itself
and had already produced one separation—in 1866. That of 1880 was the
consequence of differing responses by the National Liberal party's factions to
challenges posed by Bismarck's change of front in domestic politics since
1875. And those responses were themselves conditioned by the development
of the German economy, expansion of the German upper Mittehtand and
growth and divergence of the interest groups composing it.86
Bennigsen's talent for compromise was all that had kept the cleavage of
1880 from occurring earlier. Through successive crises he had managed to
hold the party together and avoid a lasting break with the Bismarck government. Increasingly, however, his compromises had become less a matter of
finding the true "diagonal of forces" than of rationalized subjection to the will
of the chancellor. In men like Lasker, Forckenbeck, Bamberger, and Stauffenberg the compromises produced repeated crises of conscience that ultimately
became intolerable. Again and again, they sacrificed in the expectation—
which deteriorated to a hope—that what was surrendered today could eventually be regained tomorrow, if not under Wilhelm and Bismarck, then certainly under their successors. But Wilhelm survived Nobiling's buckshot, and
Bismarck, despite bad health and long absences, remained politically dangerous.
The heated caucuses over the tariff act of 1879 were the most divisive that
the National Liberal party had yet known. That they ended with the defection of a right-wing group and not the left-wing faction headed by Lasker was
owed only to Bismarck's bargain with the Center party. Passage of the Franckenstein clause compelled moderates and democrats to find common cause in
opposition to the entire statute. Stunned by overwhelming defeat at the polls
in October, the national liberal caucus in the Prussian Chamber of Deputies
held on to its unity during the winter session of 1879-1880. Heinrich Rickert,
a relative newcomer, who replaced Lasker as leader of the left wing, avoided
forcing the issue.87 When the Reichstag caucus reconvened in late February

1880, however, Bennigsen came face to face again with Lasker, Bamberger,
Stauffenberg, and Forckenbeck, none of whom sat any longer in the Prussian
chamber. His clash with Forckenbeck over the party's position on the military
bill was especially bitter, the disagreement so deep that all four leaders of the
left ceased to attend caucus meetings.88

* The Change of Front Completed, 1 8 7 9 - 1 8 8 0 *

Even under these circumstances the national liberals were not entirely
toothless. In the Chamber of Deputies Bennigsen continued to fashion his
compromises, amending the railway purchase act to establish some legislative
control over surpluses that a state-owned system might generate and incorporating liberal features in government bills for reform of the Prussian administration. In the Reichstag many national liberals joined the opposition on
the Samoa, Hamburg, Elbe, tobacco monopoly, stamp tax, and other issues
that made the government's legislative program for 1880 relatively fruitless.
To "Laskerites" the really great issues were renewals of the Septennat and the
antisocialist act, two compromises of earlier years that imposed painful sacrifices in parliamentary power and popular liberties. To Bennigsen and the
moderates, however, those statutes were bulwarks against foreign attack and
internal subversion that were now more necessary than ever. Abroad the
alienation of Russia in the wake of the eastern crisis and Congress of Berlin
raised the specter of a two-front war; at home the continued progress of the
socialist movement, evident in recent victories in Reichstag by-elections,
meant that the state must retain not only the statutory instrument for legal
suppression, but also the military force with which to meet a revolutionary
outbreak.
Politicians of both wings sensed a conservative current in the population.
From Bavaria Stauffenberg reported general political apathy; no one seemed
to have an opinion, unless personal interests were involved. This environment made it easier for moderate liberals to contemplate allying with the
conservative parties in support of the government on critical issues. Another
motive lay in the dynamics of the parliamentary situation. Not to ally with
the conservative parties was to allow for the possibility that conservatives
would ally with the Center. Out of that combination could come a "reaction
in school and church," which to Johannes Miquel, after Bennigsen the most
important leader of the moderates, was of greater concern than political reaction. To Miquel alliance with the conservative parties under these circumstances was a matter of Realpolitik; to Lasker "political realism" meant the final
effacement of liberal idealism.89
By mid-March 1880 the four leaders of the left wing—Forckenbeck, Bamberger, Stauffenberg, and Lasker—were actively discussing resignation from
the party. For the time being, however, only Lasker took this decisive step
(March 15), no longer able to reconcile the politics of compromise with the
demands of conscience. What the protective tariff, Septennat, and antisocialist statutes had begun was completed by the enabling act. Bennigsen and Miquel were well aware of the probable consequences for party unity if the mod85

537

erates, in their anxiety to appease Bismarck, should deliver into the
chancellor's hands the power to demolish state supremacy over the Catholic
church, which liberals had labored so hard to erect. The compromise that
Bennigsen finally struck sacrificed the so-called "bishops' paragraph"—for
Puttkamer the "nucleus of the bill"—but did make possible the appointment
of substitute clerics (Kapituforvikare) to administer vacant dioceses by allowing
the government to dispense with the oath of loyalty to the May laws. But this
concession was too much for half of Bennigsen's colleagues. Forty-three national liberals voted for and forty-five against the bill in its final form.90
During July 1880, Forckenbeck, Stauffenberg, Bamberger, and Rickert
agreed to join Lasker's exodus. Their aim was to become the nucleus of the
great liberal party for which Forckenbeck had vainly called in his city convention address of 1879. Lasker and Rickert wanted to build from the ground up,
establishing an organization of "moderate and firm elements" that would carry
their cause to the voters. But the signers of the declaration published on August 30—a declaration that stressed the interdependence of economic and
political freedom, the preservation of constitutional rights, tax equity for the
lower classes, and state control over church and school—were all parliamentary deputies (sixteen from the Reichstag and ten from the Prussian Landtag).
The name that they chose—"The Liberal Union"—expressed their hopes.
