The Hamas terror raid was an atrocity with no tactical military purpose whatsoever. It is not hard to condemn. 

I forgive those that simply have the wrong information on this. Maybe they haven't seen the dozens of explicit first hand video evidence of Hamas committing infant beheading, public rape, immolation, mass-kidnapping and bare-handed slaughter of parents in front of their own children. Or maybe they don't know that you can't attack a densely-populated city state which only launches artillery from hospitals, apartment buildings and schools without inadvertently killing innocent civilians. 

But armed with that knowledge, it is morally depraved, for someone to use their limited energy to redirect people's limited attention away from these unforgivable crimes onto some historic grievances which move accountability onto Israel in some shameless tribal power move. Nothing, absolves Hamas from this.

Of course, there are legitimate moral questions about how Israel came into existence and certain actions they have taken. Abuse begets abuse. And some people also seem to think the right path in 2023 is to ethnically cleanse millions of Jews from Israel. Sure, take this medieval view about generational land rights for particular people, place and time, but admit you're just a player on a tribal team.

Some people are locked into a specific narrative of genetic-ancestral identity. They accord land-rights to a particular group in 2023 because the local communities of their great-grand parents suffered a historic grievance. But this isn't applied to other diasporas which occurred around or after the same event: Chinese Tibet and Xinjang, Turkish Cyprus Ottoman Armenia, Germans in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Kaliningrad, the entire territory of which remains occupied to this day.  They pattern match the victim according to an identity criterion and redefine -isms such that they can only act in one direction. That is called semantic power games, not ethics.

Victimhood is not exclusive to a specific culture, class or creed, and it does not grant one unilateral moral superiority. The world is messy and impossibly complicated. Supporting a trendy cause which costs one nothing does not make one a good person. 

Just some evidence of this exactly phenomenon; about 15 Harvard student organizations signed a letter blaming solely Israel for these terror attacks. They when, a tweet surfaced that big companies want to know who the identities of the terrorist endorsing students. All you can see is people claiming they weren't asked about that specific letter, or even rescinding the letter itself. No skin in the game. Pure social posturing. 

I say this at the present moment on October 11th, before all the possible atrocities which could change the picture: If someone can look at a stone cold-blooded massacre that served no military purpose whatsoever, and their first thought in the succeeding hours is to defend the political movement that perpetrated it, because it basically feels good in their friend group or in polite society; I suggest them to look up the banality of evil and not to conflate popularity and truth. Condemning the terrorist dictatorship, at the cost of showing sympathy for Israel at this moment is the humane thing to do.
