A large minority of people across the western world believe their jobs are totally meaningless. 

In the UK, the question was :

> Is your job making a meaningful contribution to the world?
>
>— [YouGov, 2015](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2015/08/12/british-jobs-meaningless) 

The response was: __Is not': 37%__ with 'Is': at 50% and 'Don't know': 13%

In the US, the question was:

> Do you think that your job is or is not making a meaningful contribution to the world?
>
>— [YouGov, 2015](https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2015/08/14/one-quarter-americans-think-their-jobs-are-meaning) 

The response was: __'Is not': 24%__, with 'Is': 63%.

In the Netherlands, the original poll URL is broken (“[Vier op tien werknemers noemt werk zinloos](http://overhetnieuwewerken.nl/vier-op-tien-werknemers-noemt-werk-zinloos/) , accessed July 10, 2017"), but it is referenced in [this 2018 article](https://www.volkskrant.nl/columns-opinie/er-is-een-ongelooflijke-hoeveelheid-dode-tijd-bijgekomen~bcc09392/?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator.com%2F). The poll was apparently conducted by 'Schouten & Nelissen' on 1,900 Dutch people after 2015 and claims the __40% of respondents replied that their job is meaningless__.

All polls are difficult to trust but this one particularly so because it is sensitive to the exact phrasing of the question. Should it focus on 'meaning', 'value', 'utility', 'importance'. All of these are responsive to the individual's prejudices and their self-image, and a comprehensive definition of meaningful contribution is not provided. Secondly, this question is an existential one as work gives structure and meaning to one's life. It is not trivial to attest that your life's work was wasted. Individuals are best placed to understand the value of their own role, but they are perhaps the most likely to defend its importance, for the sake of their own ego and self-worth. But this means that then an individual claims his job is useless, we should believe him.

## Types of Bullshit Jobs

David Graeber, in _Bullshit Jobs,_ set about codifying the sources and types of bullshit jobs.

### Flunkies 

Jobs that only serve to improve someone or something's reputation, image or perceived value. A product of vanity. Throughout recorded history, rich and powerful men and women have tended to surround themselves with servants, clients, sycophants, and minions of one sort or another. 
- Doormen pressing the open-button, allowing residents to enter their building.
- South Africa: car 'guards'
- Brazil: Lift operators
- Receptionists in companies that just need to be seen to have a receptionist or P.A.s where there are no calls to take. 
- Cold caller on behalf of a broker offering free research material, to make the broker seem busy.
- Portfolio Coordinator, without a real job description, actually functions as PA to the director and serves to make the rest of the team feel more important.
- HR Assistant hired by HR manager to do something that takes 1 hour a day.

### Goons 

Jobs that exist in adversarial situations due to the Prisoner's dilemma, destructive competitiveness, manufactured demand, excessive supply, and con-schemes.
- Lobbyists
- public relations, 
- strategic communications,
- telemarketers
- corporate lawyers.

### Duct tapers 

Jobs that exist to treat symptoms rather than the root cause of a problem. Short-sighted, temporary remediation. Lack of long term strategy. 

- IT people who spend all their time repairing out of date systems, 
- Programmers who duct-tape open source together rather than working directly on open source.
- Corporations who plan the obsolescence of their products with batteries,

### Box tickers

Jobs dominated by compliance, cover-your-arse or self-justifying paperwork that exists only because the value in the paperwork, accreditation, or analysis is more significant than doing the task itself. Work is appraised via abstracted bureaucratic procedure, not by practical, personally accountable means. All bureaucracies work on this principle: once you introduce formal measures of success, “reality”—for the organization—becomes that which exists on paper, and the human reality that lies behind it is a secondary consideration at best. Value of third party accredited qualifications or approved documentation greater than personal trust. Ass covering, fear of liability, obsession with compliance over competence.

- Auditors such as the big four who consistently fail to notice million or billion dollar holes in the company's finances,
- Consultants do provide no new meaningful insights who are paid for their brand value to endorse organizational change,  sway board decisions and shift responsibility and risk away from the executives,
- Actively managed investment funds which deliver equal to the market rate of return. They are instead salespeople,
- Lawyering,
- Even structural engineers reports for small construction are largely post-hoc for insurance purposes. The builder has often already installed the beams.
- Bullshit corporate training, 
- Consultancy Companies forcing meaningless charity events on employees purely to meet the criteria of Times top 100 employers list, 
- Professional accreditation systems, 
- Internal company magazines, 
- Long, verbose emails, 
- Internal timesheets when there is no client to log time to.


### Taskmasters 

Unnecessary levels of supervision They act as liability buffers or simply because upper management has a lack of trust in lower ranks and won't allow them to operate independently. 

- Middle management, 
- project managers, 
- individuals managing teams who people who transcribe invoices into accounting software
- writing tediously long and formal emails
- training courses that are twice as long as they need to be and deliver very little ostensible value
- the appearance of doing work over inherent values. I.e. the ability to discuss the work in appraisal and have a substantial document to support it.

## Why do they exist in a free-market economy?

While Graeber considers the primary cause of bullshit jobs to be the trends of technological automation removing the need for jobs, combined with the Judeo-Christian foundation of our culture, demanding a full-day's work in order to be perceived as a complete human being. He suggested that without this cultural imperative, humanity would have found a way to distribute the wealth of our technologies more equitably, without need for the theatre of trading productivity for cash. I do think this is the root cause. But I disagree that the solution is some universal basic income. I believe the solution is to move more people into caring roles, and embed people into their local community, so work becomes a more human centric, useful and fulfilling pass-time.

I have personally curated a number of more proximate reasons for the existence of these jobs:

### Rent seeking is incentivized

Exploitation of defined rules to accrue wealth in a zero-sum manner. The most profitable industries and individuals are often the gatekeepers of a bureaucratic drawbridge. A stable economy inherits border-control points from traditional industries, which typically gather commission on transactions. A fee because they can charge a fee. The economy is filled with short-term tasks that provide no added value, typically by exploiting the client's ignorance or poor regulatory calibration.

### Abstraction from production

Our total alienation from the very means by which our lives are sustained decouples our jobs from any sort of feedback loop. We rely _exclusively_ on proxies like establishment endorsement, precedent, brand value and personal relationships to judge the utility of roles and the effectiveness of the people filling them. The information space is too congested and there are too many factors at play to ever truly know the value of an 'operations strategy executive' for an auditing firm, or a '2030 targets implementation project manager' in a gargantuan construction consortium. 

### Decadent listlessness 

We are no longer being driven to work out of the fear of immediate starvation or physical danger, but our primal anxiety remains. This is leveraged to convince people they need to buy things they don't need or to do things that defy common sense.

### Loss of community

Geographic mobility and mass immigration is good for the macroscopic economy. But children rarely take up the jobs of their parents in the local area, and immigration reduces societal trust. Community bonds used to stretch deep into the workplace. In the extreme, there used to be entire towns working to support a common industry; factory towns. Belfast; ship-building, Hull: fishing, Liverpool: docks, Manchester: textiles, Stoke: pottery, Sheffield; steel. 

Modern work involves a total reliance on process and litigation. Breakdown of real personal relationships due to corporate mobility, burgeoning organizations, made up of strangers with only process and impersonal interactions to bind them together. People never work where they grow up, and move jobs every few years.

### Protectionism 

Maintaining, intellectual property or data either for personal job security, short term commercial advantage, or over-zealous interpretation of data-security regulations. Which prevents the ability to collaborate and creates unnecessary red-tape around useful data.

### Quarterly profit imperative

Requirement of immediate management or shareholder demand. Moves focus away from solving the root cause of problems.

### Suppression of free thought

Corporations confine the employee's ability to speak freely and honestly as result of being constantly on the record and held accountable. The common approach is to heed the Miranda warning: 'You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say will and can be used against you in a court of law'.  

As the total collapse, of interpersonal trust in organizations has coincided with both increased diversity in the workforce and the political sensitivity around diversity itself, the is very little rapport between workers, and they will often act like a herd of sheep.  Individuals have precisely zero to gain by standing out from the herd in an organization that rewards conformity. 

This means that truths are not communicated effectively. In order to humanize the office. Managers and colleagues typically interact in a contrived, unnatural way to build false rapport.

### Salaries pay hours, not outcomes

Paying for someone's time rather than for the completion of a tasks or delivery of value. This is a perverse incentive. Too frequently, employees function as serfs, being paid to appear busy to their colleges and managers. Managers are typically content to incubate their egos through the illusion their underlings are working, even if they are not doing anything useful.


## Tying it together

Ultimately, the product is always paperwork. Every single business transaction culminates in a signature on some sort of document. Reality doesn't matter as much as legal compliance or the paper-trail. It is for this reason that the commercial world feels exceptionally hollow. Our interactions are with institutions akin to a Catholic Church. An elaborate façade to keep up appearances, smiling faces, shiny expensive pamphlets with perfect ethnic and gender diversity, automated tannoy messages declaring how they are truly sorry they are for your delay, self-declared 'polite notices'. At a deeper level, you find jobsworths who will obstinately impose on you rules that they have no shame in denying any understanding of nor in professing a lack of any personal or professional compulsion to find out why they are imposing these rules.

A basic axiom of my world view, baked into me from parents and school, clearly from a by-gone age, is that work should have a purpose that benefits humanity. Institutions of existence and I find this society wide presence unbearable. Each failure of an individual to speak what he or she knows to be true for the sake of personal expediency is an incremental step towards tyranny.

At the core of our economy lies the truth that it is perceived value that matters, not actual value. All that matters to stock charts and projections and the betting market of investment is belief. Belief that something has value is the route to accruing confidence. It matters not whether that something has any actual value as determined by common sense.

It is not just a case of bullshit vs non-bullshit jobs. Most non-bullshit jobs have a large proportion of bullshit; nurses, doctors, teachers, and policemen all complain about the quantity of useless paperwork required. 80% of all paid employment in the information sector in established firms is simply time spent being present, engaging in the theatre of work and accumulating 'experience'. There is no way to measure how good someone is in a task, so they use procedures to control what you do and where you do it. The structure of the organization is simply to have a list of CVs living out their full-time work life going through the motions of office life to justify the huge sums of money they charge. The value they deliver is not effectively priced because the existing companies have no real competition due to complicated regulation and professional standards.  The barrier for entry for any challengers is simply too high.

Consultants from McKinsey, Bain, BCG, all do one thing — they make slide decks with things in them that validate an idea someone has already had at your company. Then they charge you millions for those slide decks.

## The counter-argument 

Shortly after Graeber released his essay, the economist published a rebuttal, which argued that the purposeless feeling of the modern working world was an illusion. The incomprehensible nature of these jobs was simply due to the inherent complexity of an advanced economy. That people simply cannot understand the utility of their role from their narrow, local perspective, but that, viewed holistically, they do function as a cog in a greater machine.

The trouble with this is that it is non-falsifiable and responds only to the claim that the _individual_ cannot know the true value of their job. It appeals to the notion that it can't possibly be true, because the implications are too great.

It is also the inverse argument that bullshit sectors have used for decades, their superfluous existence. 'You can't possibly judge become you have to work your whole life in the sector to understand.' Isn't it convenient that those who have most to lose by being judged bullshit are the only ones allowed to have an opinion on it.

Parkinson's law inflates the staffing, the company creates make-work to maintain the illusion of importance and urgency. But these organizations do nonetheless deliver a tangible, a core product. It is just wrapped with layers of bullshit, layers that only the executive and middle-management of the organization can collectively decide the utility-of. But these managers have the most to lose by removing the bullshit. They have worked their whole lives developing a niche competency in this exclusive area, their managerial salary is justified by the people they manage, and the executives can't risk breaking the entire company by firing them and hoping for the best. So the bullshit becomes cemented on, hardening over decades.

Even if it were true, that the individual can't judge his own value in a computer repair business or auditor or engineering firm, it is self-evident that the economy is full of bullshit. The machine is not well optimized. It was not designed by an engineer to run according to the laws of physics, but by lawyers, to run by the law itself.

## Rare Examples of People Publicizing the Truth
