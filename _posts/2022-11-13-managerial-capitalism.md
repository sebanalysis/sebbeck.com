Our post-1970 economic situation is best defined as managerial capitalism. It is a highly ordered, with a well-defined set of rules on how to excel. Your status is overwhelmingly measured by your finances, since previously non-economic establishments are all financialized. The average intelligent person who receives sufficient support in childhood will achieve this success by following a limited number of pre-packaged careers: banking, management consulting, financial analysis or auditing. This set of rules is only self-evident to an elite subsection of society, and there is an elaborate argument made about the utility of these careers that provide a defence for the status quo. We, the west, live in a low-innovation equilibrium state where oligarchic monopolistic companies dominate the economy and have achieved regulatory capture.

The key characteristic of the managerial society which contrasts with the bourgeois capitalism of the past is that organizations are no longer owned by the people who operate them. The transition of America from a 'bourgeois-', to a 'managerial-' society was analysed in [James Burnham —The Managerial Revolution: What is Happening in the World'](/assets/2022-11-13-managerial-capitalism_pdf_1.pdf). We have gone from maker's to managers' world and yet, inequality has been rising in the USA since 1971.

The problem is not capitalism itself, but the forms of corruption that have crushed innovation and increased inequality. Corruption is mostly enabled by the excessive abstraction of management, processes, and ownership from real production and real services.  

I see excessive financialization as a form of corruption because it provides a 'fiduciary responsibility' (a.k.a.  excuse) to increase the fraction of returns to shareholders who, in return, hire the CEOs who are most successful by that metric and sign off higher salaries. It is effectively a bribe from shareholders to C-Suite to maximize short term returns. But this process, typified most abhorrently by the Boeing saga in the 1990s which eventually resulted in the 737 Max disaster, can not generate innovation. And when it is standard operating procedure across all major companies, it becomes a dominant, macroeconomic problem.

The gated-institutional-narrative solution, is direct wealth distribution through higher-taxes. This is response runs counter to all good data and aggravates the core issues we currently face; oligopolies which have achieved regulatory capture, stagnating innovation in the physical world, and the inevitability of automation. But wealth distribution is a convenient scapegoat that maintains the equilibrium. 


The few examples in Scandinavia where high tax and quality of life coincide are anomalies amongst high quality of life countries. The thing all the successful countries (Switzerland, Scandinavia, Luxembourg, Singapore, Israel) have in common are: free-markets and good government.  Good government is essential , but there is no formula to install it. The governance of a country is embedded over hundreds of years and is rather difficult to change. For example: 
- the English common law system of the Anglo-Saxon countries contrasts strongly with the continental (Napoleonic inspired) law system of the rest of the world. The common law is defined mainly by precedent, and is thus more adaptable and flexible, and often makes these Anglo-Saxon countries easier to do business in. But none of these countries are ever likely to entirely switch systems.
- Some countries place more of an emphasis on devotion to work and results (Germany, Switzerland, Scandinavia, Japan), and in others the cultural sphere (France, Spain Italy). There is a self-evident difference not just across government, but the whole identity of a nation cannot be changed by politics.

But there are also countries with terrible and ineffective governments who are reasonably successful (USA, France, Britain) but have large inequality problems. In these cases, it makes more sense to make the government's scope narrow—focus it on important issues that the market cannot solve well (healthcare, public transport, electricity, and gas supply), and rely on the market for this that it can do well.  

But since the 1970s, the market is not truly free, and the economy is dominated by financialization. Modern economies depend on a thriving financial sector, and the U.S. finance, insurance and real estate (FIRE) sector now accounts for 20 percent of GDP — compared with only 10 percent in 1947. Money is just lines of code on a mainframe. Cryptocurrency provides a structural alternative to traditional finance, disposing of the need for trusted third party verification of every transaction, because the ledger is entirely independently verifiable. On top of the corrupt usury of large banks, there is also a whole array of auxiliary services, such as actuarial firms, which don't materially add anything to the system.

This is the recurring problem across the entire global labour and social rights movement. They believe they can use the government, however bad it may be, to control cultural and legal norms and thus solve the problem of injustice and inequality through mandated wealth distribution law and rules. They fail to see that the overwhelmingly consequential difficulty we _currently_ face is lack of competition in ways to generate wealth, and any attempt the government makes to milk these industries for more cash is doomed to fail.

Which equilibrium state would you rather live in:

- a bloated and inefficient government which wrenches raw cash via tax from oligopolies to give as pittance to the masses who are largely engaged in make-work jobs. No meaningful innovation. Run by managers who are trained in glorified etiquette classes and networking experiences MBA's to advance their salary capture adventure via their stakeholder management. Regulation is constantly added.
- a targeted and efficient government focussing on key industries with a flourishing ecosystem of new companies are constantly challenging the dogma of the old firms and redistributing wealth through organic, durable means. Built on innovation and one has run by builders and pioneers who are wrought and calibrated by the real world, and one is. Regulation is being limited and rationally applied.

The problem is not wealth itself. It is that wealth should be the result of delivering a useful service. The rules of the game, however unfair, should be known and agreed. As this point, it is worth declaring my bias. I was raised under the assumption that despite how unfair and unequal life is, despite the inequality in genetics, parenting, friends, location and generational wealth. We were all engaged in a common project of building and supporting the world around us. And however unfair and unequal the rewards were, they were at least related to delivering a service. You can make money by improving efficiency. 

But I since discovered that the real rules of the game are actually different. The rules are not related to improving and maintaining infrastructure, they are largely the zero-sum project of the elite segment of organizations securing greater and great proportions of the profits from existing organizations.

Tech _is_ the anomaly, although it is now largely stagnating in terms of innovation too. The lack of regulation in the world of bits demonstrates precisely what can be achieved by true competition. And competition can even solve the very problem of monopolistic tech companies.

The 'wealth', under question of redistribution, only exists to the degree of the effectiveness of our technology. At the most fundamental level, land itself has no value without farming, as we can only maintain a hunter-gatherer existence. 

Social movements are also massively overrated in their consequences. In the arc of history, all social movements were only successful due to underlying technological developments.  It is impossible to draw straight lines between one and the other, but it is easy to see how certain movements could never have taken place without technology:

- Stone axes and fire were the necessary precursor to civilization. 
- Farming led to large centralized populations. 
- The written word led to organized religion.
- Bronze, archery, and horsemanship led to conquest and empire. 
- The printing press led to the distribution of local language bible translations, and thus the Catholic Protestant split.
- High quality ships and sailing enabled colonialism.
- Industrialization of agriculture and production and more lucrative alternatives to sugar and coffee plantations, reducing the British Empire's economic dependence on the Caribbean and enabling the end of the slave trade.
- Containerization of shipping led to extremely globalized trade and globalization.
- The birth pill and washing machines liberated women from housework and enabled feminism.
- The internet and social media led to increased polarity, distrust in politics.

Everything we take for granted is thanks to innovation, and the engine of global economic growth has been innovation. Nations with effectively no national resources can be built from nothing Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea, Israel, Switzerland, Singapore and Scandinavian countries are all highly economically competitive countries. The metric we need right now is competition.

Do we actually live in a capitalist market economy or a managed oligopolistic economy that is intertwined with the government?. The economy is dominated by sector after sector of old-line, Fortune 500 monopolistic entities that are nominally private companies but in reality they have achieved regulatory capture. Every now or then we'll get an Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, but we are largely insulated from innovating technologists.

There are two contrasting policies which encapsulate the problem:
1. The [Energy Reorganization Act of 1974](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Reorganization_Act_of_1974) moved the safety regulation of nuclear power into a new agency—the [Nuclear Regulatory Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Regulatory_Commission);
2. in 1973, [Project Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Independence) was launched, which like the French aimed at total energy independence by the  year 2000. It surveyed all the available tech and concluded that nuclear was the answer. 

These are _equally_ important projects, but the regulation progressed without problems, but no nuclear power was delivered.

We live in a society where only the 'seen' is taken into account. The 'unseen', that is the costs from _not_ taking action, are not effectively appraised. The same can be said of the lack of COVID-19 challenge trials. Our governments are incapable of taking calculated risk. But in the additional 6–9 months, when we waited for the double-blind trials to complete, millions of vaccine-preventable deaths occurred. The one good thing is work injuries are down.

The podcast [Sam Harris — Making Sense #290 — What Went Wrong? — A Conversation with Marc Andreessen](https://www.samharris.org/podcasts/making-sense-episodes/290-what-went-wrong) from July 21, 2022 presents an excellent summary of the situation.

53:00:
> Marc: "The reason startups and venture capital exists is because managerial capitalism is very good at administering large scale monopolies and oligopolies over a long period of time, but is very bad at doing anything new. The is no managerial team at any big company or any big government organization that wakes up in the morning that says “Hey, I know, I'm gonna do some crazy new thing. And if it succeeds we're gonna be heroes, and if it fails we're probably all gonna get fired." They never do that”
>
>Sam: “So, is it the principal-agent problem; the misalignment of incentives?”
>
>Marc: "Exactly, 100%. If you are a Fortune 500 CEO, you're going to make 50 million dollars a year as long as you don't get fired. A number one priority for you in your life is; « I'm going to hold on to this job for as long as I possibly can ». And every year that goes by is 50 million bucks in the bank, generational wealth for my family for 1000 generations to come. Don't get fired, don't get fired, don't get fired. So how do you go about not getting fired; don't change anything, don't do anything, take no risk, do not go out on a limb, do not try new things, don't try and do new things. Don't do anything that is going to perturb. I have a CEO friend whose colloquialism is; you don't fuck with the magic. It's working; you just don't break it. This is what they teach a Stanford Business School and Harvard Business School: you run it, by managing. They call it management school for a reason. You manage it, you run it. You do not break it, you don't take risk. So as a consequence, they don't make new things. So as a consequence, the arbitrage opportunity, the ability to make money by making new things falls on your Jeff Bezos, your Elon Musk, the people we fund and back to start new companies in the model of the previous form of capitalism which was bourgeois capitalism. But we are a rounding error on the system. If you total up all venture capital and all privately backed tech companies and, by the way, tally the number of companies in the Fortune 500 that are still run by their founders, it's like 6. So the old model of capitalism keeps coming back because you can make money doing it because it's the only way you can do new things. But managerial capitalism runs the economy. And managerial capitalism broadly runs the system, the state, that we live under. It spans the Fortune 500, the big companies, the government bureaucracies, the press, the universities, it's a classical oligarchic class. They are all agents, there's zero-principles. Nobody is in charge, nobody has the power, nobody has accountability, nobody has any of this stuff, and they do what they do, and we expect this system to do things differently and do things they used to do in the old days. Like, for example, why don't we have any new cities. Where are the new bridges, the new free ways, the new reactors, the factories for PPE for COVID-19, the new chip plants. And then we wake up 50 years into this, and we're like we don't have any of those things, we can't do any of those things any more. And this is my big conclusion. This is the system we designed and we wanted it. It's weird because it's like a shadow. It's not the constitution as it's written, it's some other thing, but whatever, but whatever it is it's obviously much more important. As far as I can tell, we'll just keep running like this in perpetuity and see what happens.

## The Pretence

There are a number of seemingly benevolent systems and institutions who ostensibly exist for some (often tautological) reason, but really exist to provide a shield or veneer of legitimacy to some other less savoury systems and institutions. Note the reoccurring theme of 'ostensible-' rather than 'actual-' reasons-for-existing.

The widening gulf between rich and poor and compounded with a weakening ability of these dual-purpose organizations to keep the public credulous (where that public has a growing availability of de-centralised, grass-root information sources) is resulting in unprecedented levels of both distrust of institutions and class-resentments. 

But in the same way that the regulatory gate-keepers of managerial-capitalism delegitimize new technological solutions that could challenge the economic status-quo, the intellectual authorities (mainstream media and Universities) are not interested in describing the situation using a model that represents present reality because that would challenge the very context in which they exist. Mainstream news organizations like the guardian and the NYC, have patently aligned partisan agendas. And higher education is one of a number of industries, now administration-dominated, due to managerial capitalism.

A devil's advocate line of questioning might be: _"You suggest there is a lack of social and political theoretical innovation, but we have seen sweeping changes in behaviour in favour of social justice movements."_

Progressivist identity politics has arisen whilst economically left wing and that now controls the norms of polite society, currently causing deep changes to behavioural norms and institutional practices.  To name a few: MeToo, Trans-Rights and BLM sweep western world. But the lack of economic relevance of these movements is precisely the reason for their success. Notice that the 'social-progress' has been limited social identity groups: sex, gender-identity, sexuality, race, abled-ness and, (a certain) religion. It costs very little for a corporation to create arbitrary rules on identity, especially when their revenue is related more to their ability to maintain regulatory control than deliver effective market competition.

The result is, that we are still stuck with 18th, 19th and early 20th century political terms like left-right, communist-fascist. And in the same way that the terms 'safety' and 'quality' are used to clobber any technical innovation, the terms 'sexist, racist and fascist' are used to clobber any ideological innovation. Our cultural imperative of tolerance and human rights, born after the allied victory in WW2, has become a peerless political weapon.

But this weapon has been wielded all too liberally in recent years. The free-handedness with which these virtue signalling accusations are dolled out is one thing, but often those dealing them cannot pretend to have even a shred of integrity themselves. And the patent triviality of these word games contrast gravely with the consequences the victims have to bear. Our worst taboos are tripwires to every comment we make on a difficult issue, and the result is a conversational status quo, with ever-increasing puritanical controls. The word game has also become a total farce to everyone involved, a theatre without any meaning beyond itself. Was it ever thus? No, and even if it were, it needs to be urgently reformed.

> Fires will be kindled to testify that two and two make four. Swords will be drawn to prove that leaves are green in summer. We shall be left defending, not only the incredible virtues and vanities of human life, but something more incredible still, this huge impossible universe which stares us in the face. 
> 
> — [G.K. Chesterton, "Heretics", Essay 20: Concluding Remarks on the Importance of Orthodoxy, 1905](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/470)

Almost everything is about signalling and prestige, almost nothing is about figuring out reality, hence, for example, why media coverage of politics seems to be deranged and surreal to those who are the objects of the coverage.
