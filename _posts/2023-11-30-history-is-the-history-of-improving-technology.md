To live in the 21st century, regardless of where you are, is to be the heir to a magnificent inheritance the result of millions of years of struggle against nature. The central reason that we live such comparatively good lives compared with 90% of our roughly 100 billion ancestors ([Estimates of historical world population—Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimates_of_historical_world_population)), is our mastery of technology, not our governance structure. The most important things to happen were the invention of the technologies which gave us power over the environment to fulfil our [physiological needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs#Physiological_needs): Water, Food, Heat, Clothes, Shelter. (Sleep, Air, Urination, Excretion take care of themselves). Our governance structure is only possible, or likely—is a direct consequence of—the liberating effect of technology on our mode of life.

The most obvious symptom of the objective improvement in our well-being (or alleviation of the “worst possible misery for everyone” as Sam Harris puts it in [The Moral Landscape — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moral_Landscape)) our the transition from human muscle to animal muscle, to 'exogenous' energy sources for the provision of these physiological needs.

> Note: I chose Spain because it industrialized late, and the transition is more visible. Ideally, I would like to present the data from the England and Wales from 1700 to the present.

We should remember more often. Every time you turn on a light-switch, remember that you didn't have to spend two weeks, every winter, mashing [Spermaceti - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermaceti) into candles with your bare hands, if you were lucky. When you turn on an electric heater, you didn't have to cut down a small tree. Every time to but a new t-shirt, you didn't have to skin a sheep. Almost every action you take in today's world is thanks to the graph above. Nothing is free of it. 

Everything we take for granted is fundamentally dependent on our use of external energy sources. This first allowed a much greater number of people to exist which created a sort of inevitable domination of pre-industrial societies in the same way that the agricultural revolution displaced the hunter-gatherer societies, and later allowed a transition from almost everyone being involved in the business of surviving (agriculture), to manufacturing, to 'services'.

> Note, the agriculture and manufacturing numbers are those involved in the sector, not those doing tasks directly required for manufacturing. The actual number of people at the coal face is typically less than half of the sector-wide figure. Most are involved in 'information' tasks like accounting, management, marketing, operations, strategy etc.

Presented like this, it is all so obvious, it is boring—we all have this tacit knowledge. But part of my coming-to-terms with this world, and understanding how it actually operates, has been to realize that this lens not the 'conventional wisdom' at all. When I finally began to understand the conversations being had on the radio, morning news, I began to understand that the population are almost exclusively preoccupied with the sense of feeling part of the governance structure. The true grand arc of history: technological improvement, has been replaced in the modern mind by the arc of 'social progression'. To the degree that we do measure technological improvement, it is through the abstraction 'economic growth', more specifically, the numerical measure of gross domestic product. Which is just that, an abstraction, the conventional wisdom is that wealth, is purely numerical. The de-facto premise of _any_ debate is the notion that there is this thing called 'money' and the billionaires have it.

The conventional wisdom, is that we have somehow evolved beyond our energetic needs, and that industry, is tangential to the real project of governance. By framing the path of history in this way, we have betrayed our inheritance and the struggle for it. 

Now, I know that the aimless state of our 'national conversation' likely is the simple product of an unprecedented huge populace, entirely free from the existential burden of daily hunting, gathering, or toiling the fields in order to remain alive. The daily struggle is the artificial abstraction of winning money in the 'job market'. The currency is no longer the direct acquisition of physiological wellbeing (Water, Food, Heat, Clothes, Shelter) or 'resources', it is the indirect acquisition of 'resources', in the form of money. Thus, the working configuration of our minds, the incentive system behind our every action is 'money number go up = good'. The result is functionally a power struggle in a zero-sum game. Zero-sum, if technology doesn't improve.

All social movements were only successful due to underlying technological developments. It is impossible to draw straight lines between one and the other, but it is easy to see how certain movements could never have taken place without technology:

- Stone axes and fire were the necessary precursor to civilization. 
- Farming led to large centralized populations. 
- The written word led to organized religion.
- Bronze, archery, and horsemanship led to conquest and empire. 
- The printing press led to the distribution of local language bible translations, and thus the Catholic Protestant split.
- High quality ships and sailing enabled colonialism.
- Industrialization of agriculture and production and more lucrative alternatives to sugar and coffee plantations, reducing the British Empire's economic dependence on the Caribbean and enabling the end of the slave trade.
- America won against the Japanese because of superior industrial capability, not because of better dicipline, or national unity.
- Containerization of shipping led to extremely globalized trade and globalization.
- The birth pill and washing machines liberated women from housework and enabled feminism.
- The internet and social media led to increased polarity, distrust in politics.

Now, because of our lack of appreciation of the source of our wellbeing being technology, the preoccupation becomes the acquisition of power inside the zero-sum game. The branding for this acquisition of power comes in the form of 'progressivism'. Also called '[Whig history - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_history). This is the conventional framing of history, this is the basis premise of all debate. The problem being that is impossible to actually have good governance whilst we are haggling over a derivative abstraction of wealth. The tragedy of our situation is that the true source of wealth grows only incidentally, and we keep on suffering in the mean time.

So, despite practically everyone knowing that we have been freed from the daily existential suffering surviving because of the technology we made for ourselves, and our paradigm remaining true, only because we continue to use this technology, practically no one is operating or more importantly arguing to governance decisions on this basis. Technological advancement is simply not the frame of debate. It's not even that its not in the Overton window. Its as if the window is on the other side of the building. We are looking in totally in the wrong direction.

This is why politics is boring. It is just power. We need to collectively understand that technology is the source of our wealth.
