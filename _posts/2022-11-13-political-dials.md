Supporting a political party is like supporting a sports team. Even if you limited your concern to just 20 different political issues, each with 3 possible stances. That makes a [combinatronics](https://sebanalysis.github.io/2022/11/09/combinatronic-maths.html) [permutation with repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation#Permutations_with_repetition) problem, with $$20^3$$ i.e. $$8000$$ possible solutions. The likelihood of your alignment with any political party simultaneously on all of those issues is effectively $$0$$. So debating which team to support is only useful as far as you are deciding how to temporarily compromise when you are asked to vote. Lifetime political party affiliation is just an advertisement of your own intellectual failure.

### Political Issues are all Dials to be Set

I see each political issues not as binary decision, but as spectrum. They can be thought of as dials which can be too low or too high at any given moment in time. Your political position is actually defined by what you think needs to happen to those dials at any given moment. Do we need free-speech or moderation, rights or responsibility, regulation or liberalisation? Each of these dials, have a difference response when applied to a different scope: location, time-frame, topic. 

This is why it makes no sense to critise people for taking different stances at different moments in history. It is not 'flip-flopping' to adjust your dials dependant on the world around you. The pendulum swings to and fro for good reason.

### My Current Political Dial Settings for the West

- Prioritise market competition over wealth redistribution
- Prioritise facts over feelings
- Prioritise actions over words
- Prioritise responsibility over rights
- Prioritise the scientific method over scientific establishment
- Reprioritise unseen, secondary and long-term consequences

The most important issue to me is to stop pursing the failed policy of redistribution of wealth through increased taxes and start demanding increased competition, efficiency and innovation. Remove the regulations that protect incumbent, monopolistic organizations from competition. 

Secondly, the western elite universally prioritises empathy over rationality. It is enough to smear someone as 'unsafe' or 'discriminatory' without every having to address legimimate arguements. This tactic stops most reasonable people from ever speaking out against social justice insanity because its simply not worth speaking the truth. We have to grant an equal weight to unseen, secondary and long-term effects, rather than cowing to the whims of the most vocal, self-victimising offense-takers.
