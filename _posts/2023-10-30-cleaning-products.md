Every time I enter a supermarket, I am completely confused by the array of cleaning products. Selecting amongst the various brands without understanding any of the underlying chemical actions gives me a decision fatigue that reduces my desire to even think about cleaning anything. So I decided to understand the mechanisms, so that I can look for chemicals rather than brands. 

I did the same with glues and found it extremely liberating. For example, for glues, there are basically 3 variants that you will actually want to use: cyano-acrylate (clear, non-viscous, hard, fast setting, 'super-glue'), poly-urethane (clear, gel, flexible, slow-setting 'rubber, plastic or wood glue', i.e. gorilla glue, which also has a foaming and expanding agent) and epoxy (2-part mixture, hard, very strong, slow-setting, viscous). Useless glues for children's arts and craft projects include PVA and glue-gun hot-melt adhesive (a mix of polymers, resin-tackifiers and waxes).


## Whitening (a.k.a. Bleaching) Clothes

Bleach just means whitening and/or removing stains. Home use only only involve the confusingly named chemical process called 'Oxidation' (as opposed to the opposite type called 'reduction').  Confusingly named because oxidation can be performed by many different chemicals, not just oxygen. Household bleaching products include either a chlorine oxidiser or an oxygen oxidiser:

- 'Active-Chlorine'/Chlorine Bleach.  Only use with white stuff. Household liquid bleach (Sodium Hypochlorite) is most common, but has a shorter sell-by date (is less stable). Also you can get Sodium Troclosene (NaDCC) solid tablets. The result is the same as if you bubble chlorine gas through the water but with some contaminants. You get water filled with 'active-chlorine' ions: HOCl-, and OCl-. These ions are what actually do the killing and whitening. Chlorine bleach turns makes everything whiter, and makes black dye orange.
- 'Active-Oxygen'/Oxygen bleach, stupidly called 'oxy-action', means Hydrogen Peroxide (and precursors which dissolve to make it:  (Sodium percarbonate (a.k.a. sodium carbonate peroxide) and sodium perborate). The end result is Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2), which is a liquid, of its own, which dissolves well with water (similar to alcohol), with a boiling point of 150 degC. Pure Hydrogen Peroxide is highly unstable: it will rapidly decompose into H2O and O2, or, a tiny fraction of the time hydroxyl radicals (•OH). It is these •OH radicals which do the bleaching. Because the liquid decomposes, it is sold in the solid precursor form, or in a pressurised container, which retains the oxygen off-gas under pressure. It is much more stable when dissolved in water, but will still decompose.  Hydrogen peroxide is basically just an effective stain remover in clothes, i.e., it won't discolour them. It is much more common in washing because of this.

## De-Calcifying (a.k.a. Removing Limescale)

Vinegar, (Ethanoic acid solution) is the best way to do this. Culinary vinegar is typically 8%, but cleaning vinegar is typically 14%. It dissolves the CaCO3 into carbonic acid and Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions. In a kettle, its fine, just dump the water out. But in an iron or steamer, dissolving the Carbonate back in increases the hardness which causes it to re-precipitate elsewhere in the system because steam doesn't carry the carbonate out with it. However, I have found that in vigorous boiling, some highly acidic liquid water droplets are entrained with the steam and make it out of the system, gradually pulling the carbonate through.

To prevent getting limescale, in an iron or steamer, you can take the carbonate out of the filling water yourself. Precipitate out the limescale by dissolving or sodium carbonate (found in washing soda) to boiling water and leaving for ages for the limescale to sink to the bottom, then decanting the clean fluid. Sodium bicarbonate is a weak form used in baking soda, and powder. Easier to just use a Brita water filter to be honest.

TODO: Look at the other ones.


## "Organic" Surface cleaners

I prefer to use Alcohol and Vinegar to disinfect and clean surfaces because we co-evolved with these chemicals for thousands of years, and we know that they are bio-safe.

They are both good disinfectants, but neither can dissolve fats and oil well. Vinegar cannot dissolve oil at all, alcohol can do it slightly. Rather than dissolving oil, they de-bond the greasy residue from surfaces, making it easier to wipe away.


## Cerumen Removal

Cerumen is the medical term for earwax. It typically has a slightly acidic pH, means you ear 'wants' to stay that way.

I perceive these two treatments as quite good. Leave at least a day between both because the react loudly: 

- Sodium bicarbonate has the effect of dissolving, albeit very slowly, the wax. It makes your ear alkaline, and thus vulnerable to infection. You are recommended to hold your entire ear canal full of it for five minutes per side, it can be quite aggressive. 
- Vinegar (CeruCalm or Ear Calm) also seems to have some good ability to dissolve wax. It also serves to prevent infection, due to mild acidity. It comes mixed into an oil emulsion which helps to lubricate the ear canal too. 

I recommend flushing with a water syringe or bulb after a few days of use. 

I perceive these two common treatments as quite useless: 

- Olive-oil can lubricate the canal, making removal easier. But it has no effect on the wax.
- Hydrogen peroxide decomposes and foams-up when it touches the earwax because it is catalyzed by the presence of the catalase enzyme. This has a mechanical effect of partially decomposing the wax, but it does not dissolve it. It can also kill everything in your ear, which makes you vulnerable to infection. I have not used this.


## Soap (a.k.a. Surfactant or Emulsifier)

Soap essentially joins oil to water and allow you to remove it.
