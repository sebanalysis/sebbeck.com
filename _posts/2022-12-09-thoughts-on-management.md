## Preface

The following are the business values which I believe need prioritization in the present economy.

An oral history, for something cultural like the transmission of values in a company, is much more effective than a set of written values because each transmission is also accompanied by some human trust and emotion which adds much needed authenticity. Oral history is also never remembered verbatim. With each transmission, it is rehashed and reformed and recalibrated to bring it closer to the truth. As different chains of Chinese whispers diverge and find conflicts when they re merge, there is an opportunity for improvement and adaptation of the ideas.

As text is just a temporary abstraction from the real world, writing values down is useful as a way to capture a freeze-frame of an ever evolving and iterating story. Values are not cold facts, they are the demonstrated actions of individuals, borne out by their behavior. Treating the codified values as dogma is a recipe for stagnation and decline in civil virtue.

## Purpose of Business Values

Modern business is nepotistic and motivated by short-term, empty profit-seeking or rent-seeking tasks which can be done at minimal cost to the business but minimally benefit the client, typically by exploiting, the client's domain ignorance, poor regulatory calibration or regulatory capture. The forces of human nature are dragging an organization in this direction at every moment. But greatness lies in defying the odds to build something better. The purpose of values should therefore be to explicitly resist the natural pull towards degeneration.

> _“Every great cause begins as a movement, becomes a business, and eventually degenerates into a racket.”_ (Eric Hoffer, [The Temper of Our Time](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1210985), a collection of essays published in 1996)

As the organization grows, resisting this becomes even more difficult and incentives become ever more misaligned, politics eat into decision-making efficacy.

> Any organization with a large, protected income will tend by default toward administrative bloat. It's the same in government, at Harvard, at Google. Unless you take explicit measures to avoid it, you'll over hire. And then you have a second problem: all the unnecessary people you've hired become a drag on the necessary ones. The unproductive people need to seem like they're achieving something, so they'll organize meetings to waste the time of the productive ones. If anyone has avoided administrative bloat, it might be DARPA. They seem to have a culture of explicitly avoiding the pitfalls of bureaucracy.

> "_All orgs get to the point where their internal processes and systems are decaying faster than any sort of intervention can save them. Like leprosy or necrotizing fasciitis, the patient still lives but their days are numbered... Keeping a bloated workforce busy on some make work Potemkin project doesn’t provide job security. It just kicks the can down the road. _"

Suffering through the inherited dogmatic processes of a previous generation breeds a sort of learned helplessness.

The vision statement poster pinned to the wall in the HR department which appeals to dynamism, interpersonal trust and quality control does not reflect the corporate culture. In fact, it reflects what is missing. Culture is what is actually seen to be punished and rewarded within an organization. 

Bearing this in mind, the following is an attempt to summarizes the key antidotes to the entropy.

My philosophy of management consists of 3 maxims: transparency, simplification, goal-orientation.

- Transparency: Wages, roles, tasks, responsibilities, motivations: everything will be open and obvious to all involved. There should be no pretense about the differing financial motivations and incentives of wage laborers and those with shares. Company information should be based on raw data accessible online, not on hearsay.
- Simplification: Remove requirements and processes that do not serve the goal. The more abstract, generally the more useless. People should never be paid to justify their own job. They should be incentivized to automate or remove the need for it, and then be promoted as they now do the work of multiple people.
- Goal-orientation: The purpose of the business is to make money from delivering a product. I refuse to rent seek or justify it as 'operating under the fiduciary responsibility to shareholders'. This only moves humanity backward. What is required to motivate people is a constant awareness of the goal. We should work to constantly and iteratively redefine the goal. 

Work should be useful. Work is rewarding not when it is 'fun' but when you can see the underlying purpose of the enterprise, and you are shouldering the load. It is possible to motivate people to show up and comply via pure financial incentives, but it is not possible to make them benefit the company by sacrificing the expedient for the correct.

When it has occurred to me, I have tried to note down the following practices:

- Logistical management of the office itself, a priority: simplify all processes and interactions.
- Any organizational fluff and documents will be ruthlessly removed at the earliest sign of their redundancy.
- Relevant organization charts and abstract processes will be physically placed on the wall.
- I will not micromanage. 
- I will take ultimate ownership for everything.
- I will instill the sense that I judge my employees based on the work they produce, not the time they spend.
- Documents to avoid the passive voice wherever possible. It is not a sign of professionalism to remove the subject of a verb. 
- Tick-boxing exercises to be avoided entirely. Where legally necessary, they will be acknowledged as such and executed with awareness.
- Work will thus be divided into either real or tick box, and the distinction will be acknowledged.
- Everything that can be automated will be automated, including HR. Human process introduces human error.
- I cannot manage a large company, it is not my desire to do so. I have to know the entire vertical supply chain for it to function properly.
- Everything to be viewed through the lens of how it enhances the company's real and tick box labor efficiency. This is to be known as 'solving problems'. All focus to be placed on solving problems. 
- Review relevance of regular ongoing meetings.
- You need a physical office for inducting new employees. Those with longer running relationships still need regular meet-ups.
- Hybrid work strategy is best, with perhaps an informal yearly quota of 10-20% of time in office.

## Removing Hearsay

Organisation tend to transfer information through human-packaged snippets in the form of emails, reports and presentations. Information is always therefore cherry-picked, or deliberately or accidentally modified. The data I am reffering to is status of contracts, hours allocated, work progress, documentation sign-off, recent decisions, bid progress, investment decisions.

The issue this is trying to overcome is that the working version of the data tends to be offline: in people's heads, emails, whats-apps, teams meetings, excel documents and note documents. The version that is therefore transmitted is a diluted version which shows the employee in the best light.

Siloing happens when this occurs horizontally, and deluded management happens when this happens vertically up the organisation.
