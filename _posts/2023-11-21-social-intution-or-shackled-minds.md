Throughout my life, I've been trying to understand whether I suffer from a unique condition that is positive or negative. The issue I face is that I often figure out life analytically rather than through innate social norms. This has led me to a considerable amount of stress but also gifted me the ability to see every situation anew. Today at the gym, an event occurred that crystallized this. I attended a body pump class with weight set exercises to music. The most complex movement is lunging, and the maximum weight is 10 kilos. I chose to wear sliders instead of running shoes to keep my feet dry. After completing the class, the instructor called me aside and admonished me for wearing dangerous footwear. She expressed extreme concern, to which I calmly responded that I would wear trainers next time but was unbothered by her comment. This led her to believe I'm foolish, a sentiment I reciprocated because I don't see the manifest danger compared to other daily activities, like cycling at high speeds or handling boiling water. The protection offered by a thin layer of nylon over my toes is negligible.

I've encountered similar scenarios thousands of times, where my unconventional actions are interpreted negatively and met with authoritative admonishment disguised as practical concern. However, these arguments often lack logical basis. Previously, I tried to counter these with pragmatic reasoning, but I previously learned that the real issue is often about the liability of the offended party, not out of any genuine concern. But in this gym encounter, I sensed another level of concern, though not verbally communicated, where she perceived my actions as disrespectful and failure to adhere to social norms, which threatened her authority. I had intentionally chosen sliders, even removing them for squats for comfort and stability. This isn't the first time I've faced such arbitrary rules. At school, we had to use specific entrances, and at another gym, I was instructed not to hold my own breath in the pool for safety reasons, to which I responded by swimming underwater lengths, and with reprimanded by a separate lifeguard.

I've acclimatized to this liability-driven world and its limitations on freedom. But when it borders on respect, I take issue. The distinction between shoes and sliders seems irrelevant, especially considering the varying attire in the same class, where most of the women are essentially wearing underwear. It's inappropriate for me to have opinions on others' attire, yet I receive unusual looks for my choices, like wearing trousers for squats. 

During the same class, I frequently comment on the unhygienic practice of using polyester or nylon towels, which lack antibacterial properties and are unlikely to be washed reliably. I also point out the impracticality of most water bottles. They are either unnecessarily heavy stainless steel with narrow necks, difficult to clean and capable of damaging the floor if dropped, or overcomplicated PET bottles with built-in carabiners and multiple seals.

I daily experience the odd clash of social norms with rationality. Being wired to not automatically follow these norms without question is beneficial for me, though it can be exhausting. This trait was especially challenging during my teenage years.
