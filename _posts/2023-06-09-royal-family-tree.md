I created a simplified version the royal family tree which only shows the blood ties between monarchs and three critical inter marriages.

The least related successive monarchs according to consanguinity were:

4. Richard III to Henry VII — third cousin once removed: 0.195% + trace contribution from Ann Mortimer.
5. Henry VI to Edward IV — third cousins: 0.78%
6. Queen Anne to King George I — second cousins: 3.125%;
7. Queen Elizabeth to King James I: double first cousins twice removed: 6.25%
8. Stephen I of Blois to Henry II — first cousin once removed: 6.25%
9. Edward VI to Lady Jane Grey — first cousin once removed: 6.25%
10. Richard II to Henry IV — first cousin: 12.5%
11. William IV to Victoria — niece: 25%
12. Edward III to Richard II — nephew: 25%
13. Edward V to Richard III — uncle: 25%
14. All others were children and siblings: 50%
