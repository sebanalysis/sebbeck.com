## The Renewable Heat Incentive Scandal in Northern Ireland (2012-2016)

One of the most obvious examples of how this has gone wrong in recent history is the renewable heat incentive.

The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scandal, also known as the "Cash for Ash" scandal, in Northern Ireland is a notable example of a poorly designed incentive scheme leading to significant financial and political consequences.

The scheme offered a financial subsidy for every kilowatt-hour of heat produced from renewable sources like wood pellet boilers. The rate of subsidy was higher than the actual cost of the renewable fuels, which was a critical design flaw.

The flaw in the scheme's design led to users generating unnecessary heat, just to receive the subsidy. There were reports of heating being used in unoccupied buildings or doors and windows being left open to keep boilers running. This was because the more heat they generated, the more money they received.

The scheme earned the nickname "Cash for Ash" because it essentially paid participants to burn fuel, leading to a perverse incentive that directly contradicted the scheme's environmental goals.

The lack of a cap on the subsidy and the higher rate of subsidy compared to the cost of the fuel led to a massive overspend. It was estimated that the scheme cost the Northern Ireland public purse almost £500 million.


#### The timeline

- 2008: Stormont decides not to join a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme being devised by Westminster, instead choosing to develop its own. Stormont later hire consultants 'CEPA' to do a study of the options.
- February 2012: CEPA deliver their final report in , but mistakenly, this report has an RHI subsidy rate higher than the cost of fuel. This is not picked up by DETI (Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, run by DUP minister Arlene Foster). They are warned by [Ofgem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Gas_and_Electricity_Markets), that it includes serious flaws. 
- November 2012, the scheme is launched for non-domestic premises regardless. The government were warned throughout about the fundamental flaws by various whistle-blowers over the following years.
- November 2014, the scheme is expanded to domestic premises. In the meantime the  budget is exceeding government capacity, many reports are flooding in, including one of a farmer in line to receive £1 million from heating an empty shed.
- February 2016: the scheme is finally closed when the exploitation becomes impossible to ignore.

The scandal implicated several high-profile politicians and led to the resignation of the First Minister of Northern Ireland, among other political consequences, but notably the civil service remained in place. It exacerbated tensions among Northern Ireland's coalition government parties.
  
The RHI scandal is a prime example of how well-intentioned policies can have unintended negative consequences when incentive structures are not carefully thought out and controlled.


## In government, “process” is incentivized instead of “function”
The following quote perfectly describes government, and this is a tragedy:

>“In the most dysfunctional organizations, signalling that work is being done becomes a better strategy for career advancement than actually doing work (if this describes your company, you should quit now).”  
>― Peter Thiel, [Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/25332940)

The civil service is an excessively well funded jobs program and social status ladder which performs functionally random decision-making, with the illusion of purpose through retroactive reasoning. Dominic Cummings has been a solitary light drawing attention to the depths of despair that the UK civil service has fallen too:

> So what does the civil service incentivize? It fundamentally incentivizes an obsession on _process_, staying friends with special interests, and empire building. \[...] In the most dysfunctional organizations, signalling that work is being done becomes a better strategy for career advancement than actually doing work. If this describes your company, quit now. Now, that describes the vast majority of activity in Whitehall. It's signalling and it's process obsession. It's not obsession on quality, it's not obsession on good services, it's not obsession on trying to get some, on trying to get useful things done.

In the civil service in 2023, we have poor incentives build in at the root. It is a system that by definition can only produce failure because the set of incentives do misaligned with the interests of the nation. Once you truly accept this fact, you realise that there is no re-helming the ship. The only way is refounding.

We have to enter a cycle of founding replacement organizations in parallel, transferring responsibility to the new org and then sunsetting the old one.
