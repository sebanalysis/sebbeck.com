People undertake counterproductive or irrational actions due to poorly designed incentives, is not unique to any one historical or contemporary context. Here are a few examples from various domains:

1. **Soviet Union Agricultural Policies**: Similar to the scrap metal example, Soviet agricultural policies often set unrealistic production targets. This led to widespread falsification of data, where farm managers would report inflated harvest figures to meet quotas, resulting in a mismatch between actual production and reported figures, leading to misallocation of resources and food shortages.
    
2. **Cobra Effect in Colonial India**: This is a classic example of unintended consequences of an incentive scheme. The British government, concerned about the number of cobras in Delhi, offered a bounty for every dead cobra. Initially, this led to a large number of cobras being killed, but soon people began breeding cobras for income. When the government became aware of this and scrapped the bounty, the breeders released their now-worthless cobras, increasing the wild population.
    
3. **Hanoi Rat Massacre, 1902**: The French colonial administration in Hanoi, Vietnam, offered a bounty for each rat tail handed in, intending to exterminate rats to combat the bubonic plague. However, people began to breed rats to collect their tails and even cut tails off rats without killing them, leading to an increase in the rat population.
    
4. **Scrap Vehicle Programs**: Various countries have implemented programs to incentivize the scrapping of old vehicles to reduce pollution or stimulate new car sales. However, this sometimes leads to the premature scrapping of functional vehicles, contributing to waste and often only a marginal improvement in environmental outcomes.
    
5. **Academic Publishing "Publish or Perish" Culture**: In academia, the pressure to publish frequently can lead to a quantity-over-quality approach. Researchers might focus on shorter, less impactful studies that are easier to publish rather than undertaking more significant, rigorous research.
    
6. **Overfishing Due to Fishing Quotas**: In some cases, fishing quotas have led to overfishing as fishermen catch as much as possible, irrespective of the breeding season or size of the fish, to maximize their quota. This can lead to long-term damage to fish populations.

1. **Wells Fargo Account Fraud Scandal**: Wells Fargo employees, under pressure to meet aggressive sales targets, created millions of unauthorized bank and credit card accounts in customers' names without their consent. This widespread fraud resulted from the bank's incentive structure, which rewarded employees for opening new accounts.
    
2. **The Destruction of the Aral Sea**: The Soviet Union's plan to boost cotton production in Central Asia involved diverting rivers for irrigation. The incentive to increase cotton yields led to severe overuse of water resources, ultimately shrinking the Aral Sea dramatically and causing ecological catastrophe.
    
3. **The U.S. Healthcare System's Fee-for-Service Model**: This model compensates healthcare providers for each service performed, like tests and procedures, rather than for overall patient health outcomes. This can lead to unnecessary treatments and tests, driving up costs without necessarily improving patient health.
    
4. **Chinese One-Child Policy Unintended Consequences**: Introduced to control population growth, this policy led to a demographic imbalance with a disproportionately high number of male births due to cultural preferences for male offspring, leading to social issues such as an aging population and gender imbalances.
    
5. **Recycling Incentives Leading to Increased Waste**: Some recycling programs, designed to encourage recycling, have inadvertently led people to consume more disposable products under the impression that recycling absolves the environmental impact, potentially increasing overall waste.
    
6. **Employee Time Tracking Leading to Focus on Hours, Not Productivity**: In some companies, strict time-tracking systems incentivize employees to focus on logging hours rather than being productive, leading to inefficiencies and a culture that values presence over performance.
    
7. **Traffic Fines Based on Income**: In some countries, traffic fines are based on the offender's income, intending to make penalties equally painful for all. However, this can lead to extremely high fines for high earners, which might be seen as unjust or could lead to efforts to hide income.
    
8. **Carbon Credits and Environmental Damage**: Some carbon credit schemes, intended to offset emissions, have led to unintended environmental damage. For instance, large areas of forest might be cleared to plant biofuel crops, or the creation of monoculture tree plantations that harm biodiversity.


## The Renewable Heat Incentive Scandal in Northern Ireland (2012-2016)

One of the most obvious examples of how this has gone wrong in recent history is the renewable heat incentive.

The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scandal, also known as the "Cash for Ash" scandal, in Northern Ireland is a notable example of a poorly designed incentive scheme leading to significant financial and political consequences.

The scheme offered a financial subsidy for every kilowatt-hour of heat produced from renewable sources like wood pellet boilers. The rate of subsidy was higher than the actual cost of the renewable fuels, which was a critical design flaw.

The flaw in the scheme's design led to users generating unnecessary heat, just to receive the subsidy. There were reports of heating being used in unoccupied buildings or doors and windows being left open to keep boilers running. This was because the more heat they generated, the more money they received.

The scheme earned the nickname "Cash for Ash" because it essentially paid participants to burn fuel, leading to a perverse incentive that directly contradicted the scheme's environmental goals.

The lack of a cap on the subsidy and the higher rate of subsidy compared to the cost of the fuel led to a massive overspend. It was estimated that the scheme cost the Northern Ireland public purse almost £500 million.


#### The timeline

- 2008: Stormont decides not to join a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme being devised by Westminster, instead choosing to develop its own. Stormont later hire consultants 'CEPA' to do a study of the options.
- February 2012: CEPA deliver their final report in , but mistakenly, this report has an RHI subsidy rate higher than the cost of fuel. This is not picked up by DETI (Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, run by DUP minister Arlene Foster). They are warned by [Ofgem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Gas_and_Electricity_Markets), that it includes serious flaws. 
- November 2012, the scheme is launched for non-domestic premises regardless. The government were warned throughout about the fundamental flaws by various whistle-blowers over the following years.
- November 2014, the scheme is expanded to domestic premises. In the meantime the  budget is exceeding government capacity, many reports are flooding in, including one of a farmer in line to receive £1 million from heating an empty shed.
- February 2016: the scheme is finally closed when the exploitation becomes impossible to ignore.

The scandal implicated several high-profile politicians and led to the resignation of the First Minister of Northern Ireland, among other political consequences, but notably the civil service remained in place. It exacerbated tensions among Northern Ireland's coalition government parties.
  
The RHI scandal is a prime example of how well-intentioned policies can have unintended negative consequences when incentive structures are not carefully thought out and controlled.


## In government, "process" is  Incentivised to Catastrophic Results

This describes government, and this is a tragedy:

>“In the most dysfunctional organizations, signaling that work is being done becomes a better strategy for career advancement than actually doing work (if this describes your company, you should quit now).”  
>― Peter Thiel, [Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/25332940)

The civil service is an excessively well funded jobs program and social status ladder which performs functionally random decision making, with the illusion of purpose through retroactive reasoning. Dominic Cummings has been a solitary light drawing attention to the depths of despair that the UK civil service has fallen too:

> So what does the civil service incentivise? It fundamentally incentivises an obsession on _process_, staying friends with special interests, and empire building. \[...] In the most dysfunctional organizations, signaling that work is being done becomes a better strategy for career advancement than actually doing work. If this describes your company, quit now. Now, that describes the vast majority of activity in Whitehall. It's signaling and it's process obsession. It's not obsession on quality, it's not obsession on good services, it's not obsession on trying to get some, on trying to get useful things done.

In the civil service in 2023, we have poor incentives build in at the root. It is a system that by definition can only produce failure because the set of incentives do misaligned with the interests of the nation. Once you truly accept this fact, you realise that there is no re-helming the ship. The only way is refounding.

We have to enter a cycle of founding replacement organizations in parallel, transferring responsibility to the new org and then sunsetting the old one.
