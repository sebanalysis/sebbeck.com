In 1944, the US Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the precursor to the CIA, wrote a Manual, the Simple Sabotage Field Menu, on how to destroy organizations. Which you can get on [cia.gov](https://www.cia.gov/static/5c875f3ec660e092cf893f60b4a288df/SimpleSabotage.pdf), on [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26184), or [github.com/kennwhite](https://gist.github.com/kennwhite/467529962c184258d08f16daec83d5da).

The section called 'Specific Suggestions for Simple Sabotage' is particularly striking. It occurs immediately after the paragraph describing how maintenance workers can destroy transmission lines.

The most striking parts, very reminiscent of modern work culture, are emboldened:

> ## 5. Specific Suggestions for Simple Sabotage
>
> \[Discussions on how to physically damage infrastructure\]
> 
> ### (11) General Interference with Organizations and Production
> 
> #### (a) Organizations and Conferences
> 
> 1. Insist on doing everything through "channels." Never permit short-cuts to be taken in order to expedite decisions.
> 2. Make "speeches." __Talk as frequently as possible and at great length.__ Illustrate your "points" by long anecdotes and accounts of personal experiences. Never hesitate to make a few appropriate "patriotic" comments.
> 3. When possible, refer all matters to committees, for "further study and consideration." Attempt to make the committees as large as possible — never less than five.
> 4. __Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.__
> 5. __Haggle over precise wordings__ of communications, minutes, resolutions.
> 6. Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting and attempt to re-open the question of the advisability of that decision.
> 7. Advocate "caution." Be "reasonable" and urge your fellow-conferees to be "reasonable" and avoid haste which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on.
> 8. Be worried about the propriety of any decision -- raise the question of whether such action as is contemplated lies within the jurisdiction of the group or whether it might conflict with the policy of some higher echelon.
> 
> #### (b) Managers and Supervisors
> 
> 1. Demand written orders.
> 2. “Misunderstand” orders. Ask endless questions or engage in long correspondence about such orders. Quibble over them when you can.
> 3. Do everything possible to delay the delivery of orders. Even though parts of an order may be ready beforehand, don't deliver it until it is completely ready.
> 4. Don't order new working materials until your current stocks have been virtually exhausted, so that the slightest delay in filling your order will mean a shutdown.
> 5. Order high-quality materials which are hard to get. If you don't get them argue about it. Warn that inferior materials will mean inferior work.
> 6. In making work assignments, always sign out the unimportant jobs first. __See that the important jobs are assigned to inefficient workers__ of poor machines.
> 7. Insist on perfect work in relatively unimportant products; send back for refinishing those which have the least flaw. Approve other defective parts whose flaws are not visible to the naked eye.
> 8. Make mistakes in routing so that parts and materials will be sent to the wrong place in the plant.
> 9. When training new workers, give incomplete or misleading instructions.
> 10. To lower morale and with it, production, __be pleasant to inefficient workers; give them undeserved promotions__. Discriminate against efficient workers; complain unjustly about their work.
> 11. __Hold conferences when there is more critical work to be done__.
> 12. __Multiply paper work in plausible ways.__
>     - Start duplicate files.
> 13. __Multiply the procedures and clearances__ involved in issuing instructions, pay checks, and so on. See that three people have to approve everything where one would do.
> 14. __Apply all regulations__ to the last letter.
> 
> #### (c) Office Workers
> 
> 1. Make mistakes in quantities of material when you are copying orders. Confuse similar names. Use wrong addresses.
> 2. __Prolong correspondence with government bureaus__.
> 3. Misfile essential documents.
> 4. In making carbon copies, make one too few, so that an extra copying job will have to be done.
> 5. Tell important callers the boss is busy or talking on another telephone.
> 6. Hold up mail until the next collection.
> 7. Spread disturbing rumors that sound like inside dope.
> 
> #### (d) Employees
> 
> 1. Work slowly. Think out ways to increase the number of movements necessary on your job: use a light hammer instead of a heavy one, try to make a small wrench do when a big one is necessary, use little force where considerable force is needed, and so on.
> 2. __Contrive as many interruptions to your work as you can__: when changing the material on which you are working, as you would on a lathe or punch, take needless time to do it. If you are cutting, shaping or doing other measured work, measure dimensions twice as often as you need to. When you go to the lavatory, spend a longer time there than is necessary.
>    - Forget tools so that you will have to go back after them.
> 3. Even if you understand the language, pretend not to understand instructions in a foreign tongue.
> 4. Pretend that instructions are hard to understand, and ask to have them repeated more than once. Or pretend that you are particularly anxious to do your work, and pester the foreman with unnecessary questions.
> 5. Do your work poorly and blame it on bad tools, machinery, or equipment. Complain that these things are preventing you from doing your job right.
> 6. Never pass on your skill and experience to a new or less skillful worker.
> 7. Snarl up administration in every possible way. Fill out forms illegibly so that they will have to be done over
