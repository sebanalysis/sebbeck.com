In 1944, the US Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the precursor to the CIA, wrote a Manual, the ['Simple Sabotage Field Manual'](/assets/oss.epub) on how to destroy organizations. The section called '5. SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS FOR SIMPLE SABOTAGE' is particularly striking. It occurs immediately after the paragraph describing how maintenance workers can destroy transmission lines.

The most striking parts, very reminiscent of modern work culture, are:

- __General Interference with Organizations and Production__
	- Make “speeches.” Talk as frequently as possible and at great length. Illustrate your “points” by long anecdotes and accounts of personal experiences. 
	- Multiply the procedures and clearances involved in issuing instructions, pay checks, and so on. See that three people have to approve everything where one would do.
	- Advocate “caution.” Be “reasonable” and urge your fellow-conferees to be “reasonable” and avoid haste which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on.
	- Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.
	- Apply all regulations to the last letter.

- __General Devices for Lowering Morale and Creating Confusion__
	- Give lengthy and incomprehensible explanations when questioned.
