The Hamas terror raid was an atrocity with no tactical military purpose whatsoever. It is not hard to condemn. 

I forgive those that simply have the wrong information on this. Maybe they haven't seen the dozens of explicit first hand video evidence of Hamas committing beheading, burning people alive, mass-kidnapping and bare-handed slaughter of parents in front of their own children. Or maybe they don't know that you can't attack a densely-populated city state which only launches artillery from hospitals, apartment buildings and schools without inadvertently killing innocent civilians. 

But armed with that knowledge, it is morally depraved, for someone to use their limited energy to redirect people's limited attention away from these unforgivable crimes onto some historic grievances which move accountability onto Israel in some shameless tribal power move. Nothing, absolves Hamas from this and __Israel, to my awareness, has never committed such an act of pure evil__. This is a tough statement for people to agree with, but to my knowledge it is factually true. I am open to change my mind if there is evidence, but it would be a hell a of conspiracy to cover it up. 

Of course, there are legitimate moral questions about how Israel came into existence and certain actions they have taken. Abuse begets abuse. Some people also seem to think the right path in 2023 is to ethnically cleanse millions of Jews from Israel. Sure, take this medieval view about generational land rights for particular people, place and time, but admit you're just a player on a tribal team and you are using the same argument as the extreme Israeli right.

Victimhood is not exclusive to a specific culture, class or creed, and it does not grant one unilateral moral superiority. The world is messy and impossibly complicated. Supporting a trendy cause which costs one nothing does not make one a good person. 

I say this at the present moment on October 11th, before all the possible atrocities which could change the picture: If someone can look at a stone cold-blooded massacre that served no military purpose whatsoever, and their first thought in the succeeding hours is to defend the political movement that perpetrated it, because it basically feels good in their friend group or in polite society; I suggest them to look up the banality of evil and not to conflate popularity and truth. Condemning the terrorist dictatorship, at the cost of showing sympathy for Israel at this moment is the humane thing to do. 

It is a telling litmus test of someone's moral seriousness, whether they can condemn Hamas without reservation. Hamas is an embarrassment to the Palestinian cause and there will be no progress whilst the Palestinian cause exonerates them. 

I think peoples motivations here are clearly tribal as always. But it is at moments like this, when you notice that this particular tribe, the New-Left you can call them, appears to see the peace and unusually civilised period of history we are living through, not as something resulting established set of global norms, but rather as a natural eternal, state of the universe. 

They seem to believe in some Rousseauian vision, where if only the imperialist USA empire could unilaterally stop oppressing the poor minorities, everything would be fairer and more just. This is the same level of idiocy that the Bush and Blair administrations had about Iraq and Afghanistan; that if only they could install liberal democracy. Instead they unleashed chaos. A chaos lasting for decades, that the Iraqi people themselves attest was far worse than Saddam Hussein. 

If they ignore basis ethics, promote a biased and deranged relativist lens, and work to destroy the moral integrity of civilisation, you don't get utopia. We live in a delicate balance between order and chaos, and we must tread carefully.
