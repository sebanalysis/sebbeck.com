I want to convey the simple fact that a central message of the  _scripture_ of Islam is to wage holy war. Moderate mainstream Muslims and some Muslim sects have been able to culturally distance themselves from this core material over the centuries but it remains a serious problem that can't be denied, but often is.

This is a very sensitive subject, but the truth matters. It matters that Muhammed tortured people, cut their heads off and took sex slaves.

### Quran

I used the Hilali translation, which is more descriptive. All the translations are available at https://tanzil.net/trans/ 

If you don't want to download them all manually, you can download them all with:


```bash
wget --recursive --no-parent --no-clobber --html-extension --convert-links --domains tanzil.net --no-directories --accept 'en.*' --reject '1.html' --directory-prefix=quran https://tanzil.net/trans/
```

I have a zip of all the files and offending verses on GitHub: https://github.com/sebanalysis/quran

The offending verses in the Quran don't single out the Jews, but they do mention them at least once specifically, along with Christians, as people not to take as friends and people who you must fight. Otherwise, they are referred to as "people of the scripture".

>3|118| O you who believe! Take not as (your) Bitanah (advisors, consultants, protectors, helpers, friends, etc.) those outside your religion (pagans, __Jews__, Christians, and hypocrites) since they will not fail to do their best to corrupt you. They desire to harm you severely. Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, but what their breasts conceal is far worse. Indeed We have made plain to you the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses) if you understand.

>5|51| O you who believe! Take not the __Jews__ and the Christians as Auliya' (friends, protectors, helpers, etc.), they are but Auliya' to one another. And if any amongst you takes them as Auliya', then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allah guides not those people who are the Zalimun (polytheists and wrong-doers and unjust).

>5|57| O you who believe! Take not for Auliya' (protectors and helpers) those who take your religion for a mockery and fun from amongst those who received the Scripture (__Jews__ and Christians) before you, nor from among the disbelievers; and fear Allah if you indeed are true believers.

>9|29| Fight against those who (1) believe not in Allah, (2) nor in the Last Day, (3) nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger (4) and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (__Jews__ and Christians), until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.

But the message to fight any non-believers in Allah's cause, in general, is very strong throughout. I have included a chronological list of such verses. The scriptural message is clear: 

> 2|193| And __fight__ them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allah) and (all and every kind of) worship is for Allah (Alone). But if they cease, let there be no transgression except against Az-Zalimun (the polytheists, and wrong-doers, etc.)

> 2|216| __Jihad__ (holy fighting in Allah's Cause) is ordained for you (Muslims) though you dislike it, and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allah knows but you do not know.

Suicide bombing is encouraged here: 

> 4|74| Let those (believers) who sell the life of this world for the Hereafter fight in the Cause of Allah, and whoso fights in the Cause of Allah, and is killed or gets victory, We shall bestow on him a great reward.

> 4|75| And what is wrong with you that you __fight__ not in the Cause of Allah, and for those weak, ill-treated and oppressed among men, women, and children, whose cry is: "Our Lord! Rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors; and raise for us from You one who will protect, and raise for us from You one who will help."

> 4|76| Those who believe, __fight__ in the Cause of Allah, and those who disbelieve, fight in the cause of Taghut (Satan, etc.). So fight you against the friends of Shaitan (Satan); Ever feeble indeed is the plot of Shaitan (Satan).

> 4|84| Then __fight__ (O Muhammad SAW) in the Cause of Allah, you are not tasked (held responsible) except for yourself, and incite the believers (to fight along with you), it may be that Allah will restrain the evil might of the disbelievers. And Allah is Stronger in Might and Stronger in punishing.

Killing those who leave the religion is explicitly stated in the Quran: 

> 4|89| They wish that you reject Faith, as they have rejected (Faith), and thus that you all become equal (like one another). So take not Auliya' (protectors or friends) from them, till they emigrate in the Way of Allah (to Muhammad SAW). __But if they turn back (from Islam), take (hold) of them and kill them wherever you find them__, and take neither Auliya' (protectors or friends) nor helpers from them.

More fighting:

> 4|104| And __don't be weak in the pursuit of the enemy__; if you are suffering (hardships) then surely, they (too) are suffering (hardships) as you are suffering, but you have a hope from Allah (for the reward, i.e. Paradise) that for which they hope not, and Allah is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise.

> 5|33| The recompense of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and do mischief in the land is only that __they shall be killed or crucified__ or their hands and their feet be cut off on the opposite sides, or be exiled from the land. That is their disgrace in this world, and a great torment is theirs in the Hereafter.

This section is particularly vivid when it specifies beheading as the punishment for those that disbelieve: 

> 8|12| (Remember) when your Lord inspired the angels, "Verily, I am with you, so keep firm those who have believed. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who have disbelieved, so __strike them over the necks__, and smite over all their fingers and toes."
> 8|13| This is because they defied and disobeyed Allah and His Messenger. And whoever defies and disobeys Allah and His Messenger, then verily, Allah is Severe in punishment.
> 8|14| This is the torment, so taste it, and surely for the disbelievers is the torment of the Fire.

In fact, unlike in the Christian bible, where the later verses tend to abrogate the earlier ones, the later verses in the Quran tend to be even more extreme. 

> 8|39| And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and polytheism: i.e. worshiping others besides Allah) and the religion (worship) will all be for Allah Alone  \[in the whole of the world\] . But if they cease worshiping others besides Allah), then certainly, Allah is All-Seer of what they do.

> 8|50| And if you could see when the angels take away the souls of those who disbelieve (at death), they smite their faces and their backs, (saying): "Taste the punishment of the blazing Fire."

I'm not clear why the translator has given examples of modern machinery when talking about 'steeds of war':

> 8|60| And make ready against them all you can of power, including steeds of war (tanks, planes, missiles, artillery, etc.) to threaten the enemy of Allah and your enemy, and others besides whom, you may not know but whom Allah does know. And whatever you shall spend in the Cause of Allah shall be repaid unto you, and you shall not be treated unjustly.

> 8|65|O Prophet (Muhammad SAW)!__ Urge the believers to fight__. If there are twenty steadfast persons amongst you, they will overcome two hundred, and if there be a hundred steadfast persons they will overcome a thousand of those who disbelieve, because they (the disbelievers) are people who do not understand.

More commands to fight:

> 9|29| __Fight__ against those who (1) believe not in Allah, (2) nor in the Last Day, (3) nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger (4) and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.

> 9|5|Then when the Sacred Months (the Ist, 7th, 11th, and 12th months of the Islamic calendar) have passed, then __kill the Polytheists__ (see V. 2:105) wherever you find them, and capture them and besiege them, and prepare for them each and every ambush. But if they repent and perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat), and give Zakat, then leave their way free. Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

> 9|123|O you who believe! __Fight__ those of the disbelievers who are close to you, and let them find harshness in you, and know that Allah is with those who are the Al-Muttaqun (the pious - see V. 2:2).

Another command to behead and keep fighting forever:

> 47|4| So, when you meet (in fight Jihad in Allah's Cause), those who disbelieve smite at their necks till when you have killed and wounded many of them, then bind a bond firmly (on them, i.e. take them as captives). Thereafter (is the time) either for generosity (i.e. free them without ransom), or ransom (according to what benefits Islam), until the war lays down its burden. Thus \[you are ordered by Allah to continue in carrying out Jihad against the disbelievers till they embrace Islam (i.e. are saved from the punishment in the Hell-fire) or at least come under your protection\], but if it had been Allah's Will, He Himself could certainly have punished them (without you). But (He lets you fight), in order to test you, some with others. But those who are killed in the Way of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost,


### Sunni Hadith

The Hadith's are collections of sayings by Mohammed. 

The Sunni and Shia faith have entirely different views on the canonical versions of the Hadith. In the Sunni faith, there are two mainHadith'ss: the Sahih Muslim and the Sahih Bukhari, with the Bukhari being slightly more prestigious. The "great bulk" of the rules of Islamic religious law (Sharia) are derived from hadith, rather than the Quran.

I found the most complete versions of the Sunni Hadith here: [The Hadith Database (iium.edu.my)](https://www.iium.edu.my/deed/hadith/)

The easiest way to get it all in searchable text form is by using bash: 

```bash
wget --recursive --no-parent --no-clobber --html-extension --convert-links --domains www.iium.edu.my --no-directories https://www.iium.edu.my/deed/hadith/
```

You can download them all here:  https://github.com/sebanalysis/hadith

There are some extreme sayings, notably, the one about the rock of the earth calling out to Muslims to indicate the location of Jews in order to murder them. It appears many times in different versions of the Hadith.

### Sahih Bukhari Hadith

The worst part is probably: 

> Volume 4, Book 56, Number 791: Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar: I heard Allah's Apostle saying, "The Jews will fight with you, and you will be given victory over them so that a stone will say, 'O Muslim! There is a Jew behind me; kill him!' "

Elsewhere, the towns people are glibly found be be discussing the genocide of the Jews with no objections: 

>Volume 1, Book 1, Number 6: The sub narrator adds, "Ibn An-Natur was the Governor of illya (Jerusalem) and Heraclius was the head of the Christians of Sham. Ibn An-Natur narrates that once while Heraclius was visiting ilya' (Jerusalem), he got up in the morning with a sad mood. Some of his priests asked him why he was in that mood? Heraclius was a foreteller and an astrologer. He replied, 'At night when I looked at the stars, I saw that the leader of those who practice circumcision had appeared (become the conqueror). Who are they who practice circumcision?' The people replied, 'Except the Jews nobody practices circumcision, so you should not be afraid of them (Jews). __Just issue orders to kill every Jew present in the country.'__

Here, Mohammed's  last words, expressing disapproval of Jews and Christians building places of worship over the graves of their prophets.

> Volume 1, Book 8, Number 427: Narrated 'Aisha and 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas. When the last moment of the life of Allah's Apostle came he started putting his 'Khamisa' on his face and when he felt hot and short of breath he took it off his face and said, "May Allah curse the Jews and Christians for they built the places of worship at the graves of their Prophets." The Prophet was warning (Muslims) of what those had done.


### Sahih Muslim Hadith

This notion of Muhammed saying something to the effect of the earth crying out in order to help Muslims kill Jews is repeated by no less than 6 witnesses in the Sahih Muslim hadith too:

> Book 41, Number 6981: Ibn 'Umar reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: You will fight against the Jews and you will kill them until even a stone would say:  Come here, Muslim, there is a Jew (hiding himself behind me); kill him.

> Book 41, Number 6982: Ubaidullah has reported this hadith with this chain of transmitters (and the Words are): "There is a Jew behind me."

> Book 41, Number 6983: Abdullah b. 'Umar reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: You and the Jews would fight against one another until a stone would say: Muslim, here is a Jew behind me; come and kill him.
  
> Book 41, Number 6984: Abdullah b. 'Umar reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The Jews will fight against you and you will gain victory over them until the stone would say: Muslim, here is a Jew behind me; kill him.

> Book 41, Number 6985: Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The last hour would not come unless the Muslims will fight against the Jews and the Muslims would kill them until the Jews would hide themselves behind a stone or a tree and a stone or a tree would say: Muslim, or the servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me; come and kill him; but the tree Gharqad would not say, for it is the tree of the Jews.
 

### Ahadith 500

The Adadith 500, is another Hadith, with a shorter list of the top sayings of the Prophet. It also mentions the Jews and Christians: 

> 259\. If someone stockpiles grapes during harvest time and holds them in order to sell to a Jew or Christian or anyone else (even if he be a Muslim) who produces khamr, he will be leaping into the Fire with his eyes open. 

> 349\. A'isha reported, The Jews came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said, "Death overtake you! may Allah curse you and may Allah's wrath descend on you. He (the Prophet) said: "Gently, O A'isha! Be courteous, and keep thyself away from roughness. (Bukhari, Muslim, Mishkat).  


## Sira 

In Islamic tradition, the biographies of Prophet Muhammad are known as "Sira" or "Sirah," which literally means "life" or "journey." There is no single "official" biography of Muhammad, as various scholars have written different accounts. However, some of the earliest and most respected Sirah works include:

1. **Sirat Rasul Allah** by Ibn Ishaq: Written in the 8th century, this is one of the earliest biographies of Muhammad. However, the original text by Ibn Ishaq does not survive; what we know of it comes from later historians like Ibn Hisham and Al-Tabari, who used it as a source.
2. **Sirah Ibn Hisham**: An edited version of Ibn Ishaq's work, Ibn Hisham’s "Sirah" is one of the most accessible and widely read biographies of Muhammad. Ibn Hisham died in 833 CE, and his work is considered critical in the study of early Islam.
3. **Tarikh al-Rusul wa al-Muluk** (The History of Prophets and Kings) by Al-Tabari: Written by the Persian historian Al-Tabari, this extensive historical chronicle, which includes a section on the life of Muhammad, is another primary source for the early history of Islam and the biography of Muhammad.

These biographies, based on oral traditions, Hadiths, and the companions' accounts, form the basis of much of what is known about Muhammad's life. They are not considered sacred texts like the Quran, but they are highly respected and used for historical and religious purposes.

I have not yet examined the Sira for inconvenient material. 


### Comparison to the bible

I have separately found some of the worst verses in the bible on: https://github.com/sebanalysis/bible. 

The vast majority of these bad verses are inside the Old Testament, which is largely abrogated by the new. In the Quran there is no such abrogation, it actually gets more extreme as it progresses.

It matters that the ratio of inconvenient to benign verses in the Quran is very high. There is no Jesus in Matthew urging to turn the other cheek. 

>  But I say to you, Do not resist one who is evil. But if any one strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also; - [Matthew 5:39, Revised Standard Version](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/r/rsv/rsv-idx?type=DIV1&byte=4563978)

The doctrine of immediate ascent to paradise after martyrdom is explicitly discussed multiple times. The reward of paradise is highly relevant to someone's willingness to martyr themselves in the struggle for global dominance of the religion.

Whereas in the bible there is only an _implied_ mention of such an immediate presence with god after death: __"my desire is to depart and be with Christ"__. It is not an exaggeration to say that the entire contemporary Christian view of heaven _immediately_ after death is taken from this one verse inside Paul's letter to the Philippians. A fact I got from [Bart Ehrman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_D._Ehrman) on [Sam Harris #125 - What is Christianity? A Conversation with Bart Ehrman](https://www.samharris.org/podcasts/making-sense-episodes/what-is-christianity)

> 21 For to me, living is Christ and dying is gain. 22 If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labour for me; and I do not know which I prefer. 23 I am hard pressed between the two: my desire is __to depart and be with Christ__, for that is far better; - [Philippians 1:21-24 NRSVA](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%201%3A21-24&version=NRSVA)

Briefly in Paul's letter to the Thessalonians , it discusses the Day of Judgement at the end of the world where "those in Christ" will be raised from the dead, whereas the dead will stay dead. 

> 16 For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. 17 After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. - [1 Thessalonians 4 NIV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thessalonians%204&version=NIV)

In Revelation, there is extensive discussion of the Day of Judgement. In general there is very poor scriptural evidence for paradise, and thus martyrdom in Christianity.
