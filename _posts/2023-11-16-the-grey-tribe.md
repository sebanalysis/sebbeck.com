In 2018, Eric Weinstein coined the term "Intellectual dark web" or IDW on: [#112 - The Intellectual Dark Web - Making Sense with Sam Harris - Subscriber Content (pca.st)](https://pca.st/episode/0f790cd2-f2dc-4b7c-a385-9caa5e312a29). I had been following this loose collection of podcasters since 2016 and it has continued to grow, and become ever more important in holding the light of rationality to mindless establishment autopilot. 

Eric Weinstein's view is that the economy was predicated on growth. But in somewhere around 1970, this growth stopped. Our institutions have been faking it and, essentially we are in a long delayed crisis. 

In 2023, Balaji Srinivasan, a tech founder provided another clarifying lens for the political situation in America, but which also applies broadly to the west. We all recognise that politics has become both entertainment and the defining element of our identity, as religion, and nation bind us together less. In the US, people are strongly divided between Blue team and Red Team led by their respective demagogues. He speaks directly to tech, the new set of elites, who, for the most part, simply want to make competitive businesses that solve problems. 

- Either ban abortion or continue to allow irreversible sex-change interventions on children. Pick one.
- Either Further fill your cities with drugs, crime and homelessness, or further grow the number of guns in circulation. 
- Hand-out further trillions of dollars to legacy corporations incapable of building anything in fake 'infrastructure bill' or hand out further trillions to arms corporations in politically fuelled wars. 

These are the establishment positions, and they live off each other. Ben Shapiro's explanation is a social one. He believes that the social fabric has been ripped apart. Reason, and objective truth have disappeared. There are two opposite information bubbles. 

## My view

Engineering innovation, the fundamental driving force behind all the progress in human existence, has largely ground to halt in the physical world. 

Put simply, in the 50 years from 1925 to 1975 we saw highly visible innovations in transport (flight, spaceflight, automobile networks), great leaps in comfort (universal sewerage networks, central heating), a multiplication of food provision tech: (mechanization and synthetic fertilizers) and countless medical innovations (wide use of anaesthesia, antibiotics). It is trivializing to sum it up so briefly.

In the 48 years from 1975 to 2023 what have we seen aside from the screens and the technology is behind them? Ask yourself what has changed about the world? Not much. This is a tragedy. 

An obvious symptom is that, global GDP diverged from energy consumption in 1970. There is a difference between the real economy and moving numbers around in a SQL database, as [George Hotz puts quite well](https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2020/08/07/on-money-creation.html).

## List of People Who I Consider Grey Tribe

All of these people do or have appeared in podcasts, which, along with their blogs is the main reason I know about them. There is no formal organisation which groups them all together, which is a good thing. 

But hopefully, the convergence of interests in actually building a better world can help to form a more rational way forward for the west. If we don't fix this ship, it will sink.
